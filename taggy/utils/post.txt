<p>I just saw this new forum, and I think it's great!&nbsp; I think that except for when I was first diagnosed, the hardest time for me was&nbsp;my POST treatment period.&nbsp; I have had&nbsp;a really hard time finding this &quot;new&quot;&nbsp;NORMAL, and even now, almost TWO years since&nbsp;my bd dx, ( I found the lump on FEB 8th, 2007!) I am still having trouble&nbsp;accepting this NEW NORMAL.&nbsp; Things have settled down a bit, but I still have my moments.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Harley&nbsp;</p>
