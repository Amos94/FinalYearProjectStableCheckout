<p>Shell...I think Anna gave some great advice.&nbsp; Fighting depression can be obtained in several ways.&nbsp; Diet is a big part of it as Bold advised.&nbsp; Eating healthy, just makes you feel better in general. The exercise is HUGE!! Every doctor tells me the same thing. I know when I am not able to get out and run or race walk..because of the cold...I feel down.&nbsp; When it part of my daily routine..I am sooo uplifted. Depression runs in my family...so I know first hand how EVIL it can be.&nbsp; I know pills aren't for everyone..and I am not a pill taker.&nbsp; But, I went on Effexor XR last February...and just recently (because of a hysterectomy in Aug and starting Arimidex in Oct), I had my dose increased.&nbsp; I was litteraly in a BLACK HOLE! I came to work, but as far as my house, family, friends, boyfriend...I couldn't deal with any of it.&nbsp; Within a week of my increased dosage, and getting back to my exercise (my diet is usually very good) I felt like a new woman!! </p><p>I pray you get some help, either in counseling (I am thinking of that as well) or medicine or journaling like Anna suggested.&nbsp; This is a tough journey we have traveled and continue to travel.</p><p>I just had ANOTHER biopsy and I felt like I was going back in time 2 yrs.&nbsp; Found out today..it was B9!!! </p><p>xoxo</p><p>Lisa</p><div class='post_sig'>Worry is for 'shit'!
