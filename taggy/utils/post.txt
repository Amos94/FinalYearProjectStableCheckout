<p>I have four important things to say:</p><p>You are now on to the emotional healing it enters the inner realm of the human heart. It explores the trans-formative power of releasing fear, pain, and anger-and embraces the healing power of self love, forgiveness, and acceptance of all parts of one's self.</p><p>The nature of the mind explores how the entire experience of life-including life with cancer-is profoundly influenced by our thoughts, beliefs, and the meanings we give to events. It also shows how we can consciously escape the tyranny of the mind and move forward on out healing path.</p><p>As cancer survivors as well as our family members we need to discover the deepest meanings and purpose of our lives and our most important goals. What do we want to accomplish, experience, and share with others?</p><p>The nature of the spirit embraces the profoundly healing spiritual dimension of life that we share and explores the nonphysical dimension of our being that is whole and complete, regardless of our circumstances.</p><p>To wrap up, we our multi-dimensional beings. Our mind heart and spirit need and deserve love care and attention-just as much as the body does. </p><p>Everything is going to be alright. I believe we are never given more than we can handle.</p><p>Live, love and laugh, exercise, eat well and breathe.</p><p>In Solidarity </p><div class='post_sig'><br />Dx 11/6/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+</div>
