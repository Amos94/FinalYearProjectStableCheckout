I will tell you what she suggested for me that helped. At night my mind would race with thoughts of surgery, medications, what ifs, on and on and on with no rest the longest I went without sleep was four solid days, on the edge if you know what I mean. My therapist suggested journaling, writing down the thoughts that weighed the heaviest, on my mind, by doing this I would be taking the consuming thoughts from my mind and physically putting them some place else. The other thing that helped was physical activity, I started taking daily walks, even better if you can really pump it up that is a great stress reliever. How about a new kitty ? Too raw ? Taking care of someone or something else can help too. I hope I don\'t sound like a know it all. My heart goes out to you and I wish you luck with your appointment.

A few tricks you might try that are all safe to combine with a sleep med:</p><p>1) take Magnesium before bed. I use a pure powder called &quot;Natural Calm&quot; that you dissolve in hot water. Take about 1 hour before bed. Buy at a health food type store or online.</p><p>&nbsp;2) Be sure you are taking your B-Vitamins early in the day. If you don\'t take them ~start! The B\'s are critical for our bodies to manage stress. And since I started taking extra B-12, which helps with metabolism and sleep, I am sleeping without sleep meds. I like Jarrow brand best because they use a better absorbed form of B-12, look for the form that starts with Methyl~</p><p>3) Small dose of Melatonin, I use the one that melts under your tongue, so it kicks in quick. 2.5mg by Nature\'s Way.&nbsp;</p><p>4) Turn off all TV, computers 2 hours before bed. </p><p>5) I second what Anna said about journal ling. Getting all the racing thoughts out on paper can help you let go enough to fall asleep ~. </p><p>All this is what my naturapath doctor recommended. There are lots of reasons why people can\'t sleep but they all add up to the same crappy result.&nbsp; Be sure to see a doctor about this, it is serious.</p><p>Peace, healing and hopefully sweet dreams~</p><p>Tay </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>I\'m writing a blog about my cancer experience, www.myturnip.blogspot.com ~ Blessings, Tay<br />Dx 11/1/2007, DCIS, 1cm, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+</div>",

I read somewhere(but dang I can\'t remember) that they could actually feed estrogen driven breast cancers. Most doctors do not even know this when they recommend them.I do what twirl girl does and it makes a huge difference. Magnesium is a natural sleep aid and the melatonin is also one of the best antioxidants we can be taking for prevention. When I started taking these supplements before bedtime, I finally stopped waking up every two hours. I also do what Beth recommends about making up stories. When I try this I go to sleep right away.

        'content': "<p>jellen...Everyone is different, but I\'d say that 13 months is not a very long time post-tx. When I was 13 months out, I was just emerging from the emotional trauma of it all. While we\'re going through the active stuff like surgery & chemo, we suck it up and go into warrior mode. Then, seemingly suddenly, all the bustle & noise stops and we\'re just stunned...and feeling like we\'re just cut loose out here & just flapping in the wind. And so we try to process it all and recover. For some I guess it\'s a snap. But for most of us, we have to deal with all of the physical residuals, like fatigue, chemo brain, pain & insomnia from tamoxifen or an AI, skin & hair changes...you name it. And then there\'s the emotional hangover..depression, anxiety, fears about recurrence, all direct leftovers from the year+ long trauma we\'ve just gone through. </p><p>Have you thought about a support group or even seeng a counselor who specializes in cancer issues? If that doesn\'t strike you as potentially helpful, maybe starting something distracting but not too taxing might give you a new perspective and engender more energy (at least emotional energy). Finally, I\'ll just add that if you haven\'t had a thorough workup to rule out physical causes for your low immunity, maybe you should start there (I know, you\'re sick of doctors, but this could be worth it!).</p><p>Hang in there, girl. And keep posting. So many of us share these issues and we can help one another get through them...together.</p><p><em>~Marin</em></p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Now and then it\'s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.  ~Guillaume Apollinaire</div>",

Step up to the plate buddy! It helped that I sat him down and told him how sick/achy/tired I was, what I needed. Not whiney, but an honest conversation, well, mostly me talking. Part was my fault in trying to protect him, not letting on how I felt so awful. I changed that, if I need help or just a hug I ask. Yeah, it would be nice not having to ask...</p><p>Go to the therapist even if he doesn\'t go with you. Even if he does, book some appointments just for just for you. It\'s bad enough trying to get through this without being let down by the one you love and loves you. Get on the phone Monday and schedule an appt with a therapist. Maybe your chemo center has a therapist there -- she/he might have some special insight. If not, they can probably recommend a therapist that has experience with cancer and family issues.</p><p>Let us know what you do, how it goes.

I went to the therapist this AM and I have alot of grief to get through. #2 son ran away 2 years ago, #3 son being sick, my mom died in Oct of ovarian cancer and my own cancer. I have been strong through all of this up till last week. Now, I cannot stop crying. I am sure being on Tamoxifen does not help. My DH is very private, not affection in public and keeps to himself. Right now, I NEED hugs and hand-holding....</p><p>I am sure that you are right, my DH thinks going to appointments is supportive. I just want MORE!

I don\'t know what to say. I\'ve just accepted my guy as-is. Is your girlfriend close enough to your husband that she could say something, or would that make things worse? My guy is private too and would find it meddling. But if one of his guy friends knew how you felt maybe they would say something. Most men worth their salt don\'t want to see a friend\'s wife sad. My guy\'s cousin saw him being an a$$hole and gave him sh*t.</p><p>Will you go to the therapist again? Maybe he/she can help you sort out if you want to keep the marriage and how to make it work.

        'content': "<p>Hi, D</p><p>I haven\'t been on BC.org for a few days as I\'m trying to get a grip on my schedule -- which isn\'t occupied with that much, but I\'m still having trouble. Another story for a different thread. Anyway, I\'m glad you\'re feeling better and Dad is visiting. That is good DH is being nice -- whatever the cause. So sorry you are having the biopsy while he is away. Will Dad still be there or will a friend be able to accompany you? </p><p>As far as the Valentines Day thing goes, my husband and I have a long-standing tradition of making valentines for each other. The crappier and more over the top, the better!! I\'m talking construction paper, glitter, paper doilies, the works. I don\'t recall how the whole thing started but it\'s just for fun. There have been some years we\'ve missed, or one or the other of us has missed. Actually, I am guilty of being the first one to miss, and last year was the second time and I told DH I didn\'t want him to give me his valentine because I felt so guilty and sad. (I was in the middle of my BC testing and diagnosis.) So he held onto it and perhaps it will come out today sometime. Yesterday I made his when a moment of inspiration struck -- I ran construction paper through the paper shredder, glued these little bits onto a card and incorporated them as part of the design.  Doesn\'t it sound beeyootiful!!!?? I gave it to him last night around midnight. He\'s been in a funk all week and kind of stressed out. Today I gave him a ready-made card that had a squirrel on it, just because we always laugh about monkeys and squirrels. Can you tell we\'ll a couple of mature adults? Anyway, he\'s out and about right now trying to gather items for tonight\'s dinner with several friends. Was supposed to be hosted elsewhere but our friend had unplanned surgery today. A few couples had already bought and/or cooked food so the event got moved to our place. Not a romantic evening, but a nice dinner with close friends. </p><p>I wish you a pleasant day and a Happy Birthday!</p><p>Hugs,</p><p>Tina</p>",

        'content': "<p>Hi Jeff -- your wife is so lucky to have such a loving husband. Going through chemotherapy really makes your body feel crappy, especially after you\'ve been on it for a while. At one point, I was weepy all the time and discovered through serendipity that it was really because my nutrition was really being taxed by the chemo. I found that acupuncture and seeing a nutritionist helped me so much emotionally as well as physically. I started some supplements and improved my diet and that helped a lot. That said, there are many days when the chemo makes me feel run down or when it seems like its taking a lot of energy just to take care of my children and hug my husband. Sometimes its hard to be the best person you really want to be. This is&nbsp;a hard time for her but your continued love and support will see her through.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Dx 1/2004.

        'content': "<p>Hi, Jeff,</p><p>Just wanted to welcome you and thank you for being there for your wife.</p><p>You\'ve gotten some very good advice. BMdaley mentioned decadron (a pre-chemo steroid). Let me just add that taking this pill made me worry more about losing my mind than having cancer. My boyfriend would come home from work, and he\'d find me either&nbsp;shaking in my shoes from an episode off &quot;CSI&quot; or crying over a TV commercial. That\'s so totally not me.&nbsp;The irrational portion of my brain had a bloody field-day on that drug. Add to that the general state of fear that goes with a bc diagnosis. Your wife may be experiencing either or both, and believe me, it makes you kinda crazy.</p><p>Something I tell every guy who comes here...don\'t be hard on yourself because you can\'t fix this. That\'s the oncologist\'s job. It\'s going to be frustrating for you because you\'re going to <em>want</em> to fix this, which will make it frustrating for your wife.&nbsp;Just listen to her when she needs to talk or cry or scream or rant. Don\'t try to fix what she\'s feeling, either. The only times I really snarled at my boyfriend were when he tried to &quot;fix&quot; what I was feeling. Don\'t go there.</p><p>The last piece of wisdom I\'ll share is, don\'t read articles published on the Internet that are older than 2005. And remember that anything published now is based on studies that began more than five years ago, so although you\'re reading the most current research, it\'s already old statistics and possibly outdated therapies. Good luck and best wishes to you both!</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 2/8/2008, IDC, , Stage IIIa, / nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

By the way, drinking does not help - at best it brings momentary relief.<br />Depression prevents concentration - so many things to do, and not a single desire to fulfill them.

But the reasons are not so easy to eliminate.<br />&bull;	Often people mistake depression for the state of emotional suppression, which they can overcome themselves. One can have his/her haircut changed. Well, the change should not necessarily be in the haircut. Any significant change in personal mirror image can very often help to cope with melancholy. It can be a change in hair colour, hair perm, experiments with make-up, or in general, a radical shift in style. Simply try to look upon yourself from another angle - and the ambient around you will change as well.<br />&bull;	Depression occurs five times less frequently among sportsmen and people who do the sports.<br />&bull;	As far as the studies of depression phenomenon went on, the scholars offered new ways of treatment. For instance, light therapy. This is most topical in spring: the lack of sunlight in winter badly affects human mood. It is not by chance that depression is much less frequent in southern sunny countries. Light therapy is believed to improve the condition of 2/3 of all patients.<br />&bull;	Beside sunlight doctors recommend to paint the wall in bright, orange and yellow colour, to think positively, learn to tell failure from catastrophe, to have a rest more often and praise oneself for achievements.<br />A survey, conducted recently, can change attitude towards diets.

        'content': "<p>Well, just like any other profession or group, there are better and worse pharmacists. Just like there are some people who are more \'grown up\' than others.</p><p>It is fairly uncommon for the pharmacist to know your diagnosis. &nbsp; They can make some educated guesses; if they get a prescription from an oncologist, they can logically guess you have cancer.&nbsp; So if an onc prescribes large doses of pain meds, sedatives, antidepressants, then&nbsp; you know it can be very reasonable.</p><p>As far as doses go,&nbsp; you\'re looking to see if a med is prescribed in a dose that is \'out of the usual range\'.&nbsp; So if a drug is usually given at 5-25mg a day for disease A and 10-200 mg for disease B, it will be really hard for the pharmacist to catch it if an error was made to prescribe 100mg&nbsp; for disease A. &nbsp; </p><p> When my GP (who handles my sertraline prescription) accidently refilled it with 25mg instead of 100mg tablets, I knew the doc had probably made a mistake.&nbsp; If the pharmacist was really with it, I think they could have caught that, because if they were tapering me off of the med, they would normally taper me off more slowly than that (sertraline comes in 50mg tablets.)</p><p>&nbsp;Privacy:&nbsp; Here\'s more on HIPAA. http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/faq/index.html</p><p>That doesn\'t mean that patient confidentiality slips don\'t happen, of course.&nbsp; Some people \'get it\' and some people don\'t.&nbsp;</p><p>I know some confidentiality issues from personal experience.&nbsp; I did not appreciate it that while at work, on the night before my excision, I was told by a collegue that &quot; &lt;the male radiology clerk, who had looked at my face sheet that contains my LCIS diagnosis&gt; wishes you well on the excision, and \'advises that you get&nbsp; bilateral mastectomies\', because he had a co-worker and that\'s what she did.&quot;</p><p>Now, a normal person may be able to laugh that off, but I couldn\'t.&nbsp; I didn\'t know until a few months later that I had&nbsp; longstanding PTSD. I\'m sure that didn\'t help matters at all.&nbsp; </p><p>As far as what your hospital pharmacist may remember about you - well, probably not a lot. I almost never see patients, so all I have to go on is what is in an order.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person has a very unusual diagnosis (if the doctor put the diagnosis on the order), or uses 4 times the usual amount of a drug, I may remember the fact that we had <em><strong>a</strong></em> patient with a diagnosis of X, or used 4 times the amount of a drug.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, I probably won\'t remember the patient name.&nbsp; The nurse is more likely to remember a patient name.&nbsp; I fill at least several hundred orders a night, and am filling medications for the entire hospital. </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>If you\'re going through hell, keep going-Winston Churchill</div>",

Also helped me out with insurance billing when I was going to be out of the country when I needed a refill on my tamoxifen.</p><p>That said, I\'ve had some horrible interactions with pharmacists at the big chains (never had a problem with a small local pharmacy) as a prescriber. The stories that my patients tell me...the interactions I\'ve had on patient\'s behalf. Ugh. As Leaf said, there are good ones and bad ones in every profession. Pharmacists in stores have a very busy job and sometimes they shortcut so we need to be really savvy consumers. Look at your pills before you take them home. You deserve to know why it doesn\'t look the same - you may have a reaction to a new generic and if you don\'t realize that\'s happened you can\'t tell anyone when they ask, &quot;What\'s changed?&quot; Also, be sure that your pharmacy will bill Medicare if that\'s what you have. In certain circumstances (blood glucose meter strips, for instance), they won\'t bill and people pay exorbitant amounts that they don\'t have to and are never told. </p><p>The other reason I go to small, local pharmacies is this: before I had insurance I would call around for prices when I had to fill a prescription. Invariably, the small, local pharmacies had the best or close to the best prices. (This was before Target, that other store that shall remain nameless, and some of the pharmacy chains had $5 lists). Target would be around the same. The chains were always considerably more expensive. No joke, there was one generic NSAID that was $29 at the local shop and $129 at Stop&amp;Shop. Anyway, we need to support these businesses!!! </p>",

I feel like I have fallen through so many cracks in my treatment and it has prolonged my treatment.I am uninsured(first obstacle) I was able to get on a county program which gave me mammagram,US and sent me to breast surgeon for biopsy and diagnosis and lumpectomy. However that is where it ended. It took me 6 weeks from lumpectomy time to get qualified as a charity case at a hospital. Free care for a year.Thank god for that. Then it was on too meet oncologists and new breast surgeons and all. Several more weeks of that and oh yeah they spotted another area of concern and needed another biopsy which came back another tumor. So I should do masectomy. Ok I want reconstruction right away, and I want Diep flap. Well have to wait 6 months for that because the Dr. is booked. So do chemo, ok, 4 rounds of A-c is recommended,(also had other onco say same thing) ok, start chemo, after 1st round told I would need another 4 rounds of Taxotere after this. WHAT???? Where did that come from? Chemo made me so sick, sick in bed 12 out of 21 days. Puking, constipation ,&nbsp; runs. Eat alot, sick after eating, pain all over weak, dizzy, nauseous all of it. Quit after 4 rounds of A-C. Lets do surgery. What? no one ever put me on the waiting list? another 6 month wait for flap surgery? oh God! Just do the damn implants! What? have to wait 6 weeks for surgery??? WHy??? I was told they were all very flexible, when I was ready they were! So 6 weeks later had bilateral masectomy. Expanders put in. Pathology report comes back Good news did the right thing in taking both breasts, other one was not infected YET but more than likely would be. Also found many other areas of cancer in different ductal systems in infected breast. There for I need more chemo! Now I am in the beginings of my &quot;fills&quot; and they want me to stop them to do chemo. Why can\'t I finnish them, then do chemo???? What\'s the big deal? I have waited this long already. I am so depressed over this. If I do my fills now, then do chemo, then do exchange surgery, I can get that all in by my financial deadline. But if I stop fills now, do chemo, then start back on fills wait 3 months and then do exchange surgery I am screwed!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>Do you see my dilemma?????</p><p>Now lets add into this mix the fact that my husband lost his job last Feb finally got one in Oct. at half pay and no benefits, he lives in the town where he works. Gives me an allowance every month, so basically we are seperated. He doesn\'t want to deal with me. So I am stuck with my newlywed daughter, she would do anything for me and has. She has driven me back and forth for Dr appt.s and chemo for the past 6 months. She is burned out. And me living here is making it worse. I have no car and cannot really drive myself anyway. Her husband would be THRILLED if I left, but go where? Now my son is in a financial bind and needs to move but needs help paying bills and wants a live in sitter for babies. Ok I can do that. But I don\'t know that we all can do it financially, and my daughter is totally against this.She thinks he will not pay up. Then she added &quot;you can\'t come crawling back to me!&quot; whether it was in jest or not, it started my crying jag and depression.</p><p>So that is my story. Sorry it is so long. Can anyone help me not go insane,or kill myself. Because it appears that I am a huge burden on my family,and if I just went away all would be good for them. My name is Cathy I am at <a href=\'mailto:coxc1@hotmail.com\'>coxc1@hotmail.com</a></p>",

        'content': "<strong>1. </strong> As a rule, problems interchange with periods of tranquil life, but during depression they overwhelm altogether, without giving a break. They might seem infinite and as if impossible to solve. But... the mind is bound, while the hands are sound. And for the mind not to be bound, it is recommended to follow this advice. Write all your duties in a column arranging them chronologically: what to fulfill at first and what afterwards. And also mark the deadline<p>Then take a blank sheet of paper and stick it over the list with two paper clips, so that only the first line is visible. Then stick the list near the bathroom mirror (even in case of the deepest depression it will not remain unnoticed). Now, after having fulfilled the duty, you can cross it out from the list and move the blank sheet down. Thus you won\'t forget to do anything and the forthcoming tasks will not seem so numerous, and the victories\' list will increase right before your eyes, inspiring you and proving that life goes on.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Good sleep is the best cure</p><p>Depression is often accompanied by insomnia. It 3 a.m. and you\'re still tossing and turning, dark thoughts crawl inside your mind, uneasiness won\'t let you sleep, and you wake up in the morning with terrible headache and totally broken. A simple formula for a good sleep - a cool bedroom, a warm blanket, a low pillow and complete silence. If necessary, you may take soft hypnotic. When we sleep, time flows faster which means that the streak of bad luck will end sooner.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Don\'t give up</p><p>When everything goes wrong there is a great temptation to give up and say: &quot;All is lost! I can\'t do anything!&quot; The thing is that gravest anticipations come true as a rule. Falling into depression, giving up and doing nothing for your own sake, you will drown for sure with pleasant feeling of rightness. But who needs such rightness? Fight to the finish, do your best, persistence brings success. It easy to die, but it\'s hard to live on.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Enjoy life to the full</p><p>It\'s excellent to learn to enjoy minutes of serenity. When another trouble is past, and all problems of the day are solved, it would be good to sit or better to lie down, relax and tell yourself: &quot;I feel tranquil and nothing can disturb me. I do not know what future holds, but this very moment belongs to me. I\'m totally fine now&quot;.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Humour is the best weapon of the desperate</p><p>Treat the situation with humour. For this you should take a detached view upon yourself. Any humour is in a certain way based on someone else\'s troubles. There\'s nothing funny to get your face hit with a cake, but nevertheless everyone laughs. Try to have an ousider\'s look at your life, like at a sitcom. A gloomy grin is better than tears.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Live for the moment</p><p>Don\'t recall the past. The troubles gone by are powerless, they cannot harm you, forget the wrongs and failures, don\'t rub salt on the wounds, don\'t recollect what cannot be reversed. And there\'s no point in intimidating yourself with troubles yet to come - there can be only one future, and you can imagine hundreds of misfortunes, majority of which will never come to pass.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>Everything will pass</p><p>King Solomon\'s ring had an inscription: &quot;And it will pass as well&quot;. And this unlucky streak of your life will fade away, the morning will come and the sun will rise. And, in accordance with probability theory, life will grant you a wide, lucky streak to equalize the unlucky one. You just need to be patient! </p>drugstore24x7.blogspot.com",

Think about it - this is a potentially/actually life-threatening disease. People don\'t waltz away from it (well, some do, I guess). The response of depression doesn\'t mean it\'s a mental illness - call it &quot;situational depression&quot; (an actual diagnosis, I think, tho it\'s been a while since I\'ve used the DSM as bathroom reading) and get some help. It is truly amazing what the right antidepressant will do. HUGS and a kick in the butt to call your primary care first thing monday morning.

My marriage ended&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an affair after 29 years. One year later I was dx with bc, went through this pretty much alone. My son who has struggled with major depression is having&nbsp;serious marital problems. I have coped fairly well until I was fired (unfairly) and have been 8 months out of work, with little prospects. Every day I pep talk myself to get moving on something, anything and every day I find myself sitting in my chair in front of the television, (so I won\'t think). It isn\'t laziness, I am paralyzed in my ability to do anything. I don\'t care how I look, I basically isolate myself from everyone. I can\'t&nbsp;make myself&nbsp;answer the phone, I let the machine take the calls.&nbsp;Sleep comes for 3 hours at best then wide awake.</p><p>I am not suicidal but I have no desire to live. This brings incredible guilt! I was given a second chance at life after my treatment for bc while so many others have lost the battle and others still face daily fear and misery with ongoing treatments. I am wasting my gift. I do recognize that this is a clinical depression. I am taking an antidepressant and xanax for when anxiety rears it\'s head but I don\'t see a way out of this. I am struggling with financial woes so seeking out help is limited. </p><p>I think everything has just simply caught up to me and frankly I\'m just so tired of it all.

It was severe, he was very psychotic. I flew down to Texas to get him and we drove back to Michigan in his car. He is now here with me on a slow recovery back to himself. It\'s so hard for us both. His wife does\'nt understand the illness and for now does not want him to come home. I can\'t judge her for that.</p><p>I am okay with my own struggles but when it\'s my baby boy, I really wonder what it\'s all for? What are we suppose to learn here? I did run into many angels on my journey to bring him home, most especially his Grama for giving me the money so I could!&nbsp;Well, my worry for him has snapped me out of myself for now but at his expense! Please say a little prayer for Ryan, I would appreciate it very much.</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp; Fran&nbsp;</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 9/16/2003, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIb, Grade 3, 3/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

I was DX with BC about 21 months ago. Since that time I have undergone 9 surgeries, and 5 rounds of chemo. My husband not only thinks I am making a \'mountain out of a molehill\' but the, get this, I caused the cancer in the first place - for attention! Can you believe that? </p><p>I am still not very well, but returned to work in January, 2 days after yet another biopsy. I changed fields and am now teaching. I came home, one day after about a week and said I was upset about something that had happened that day, at work. My husband\'s reply, \'I knew you wouldn\'t last 2 weeks.\' He had been talking about how quickly I would quit with MY SON. </p><p>He gave no thought to just what I might be going through. I went from surgery into a new profession in a couple days, not knowing the results of the biopsy.I am was and still am, working over 8 hours a day, and attending classes at night for my accreditation. I leave home at 6:30 and some nights don\'t return until 10:00 PM. Some days I get nothing to eat, outside of coffee and snacks at work.</p><p>I\'ve been having very severe headaches, and of course fear it\'s the cancer again. To make things even worse I was bitten by something last week, we think it was a Black Widow Spider, and had to get ER care. Once again, my husband thought it was nothing.</p><p>He did drive me to the hospital when I had my 8-hour mastectomy, but soon as I was admitted, he left the hospital. He did not stay, in case they needed him for anything. (I also have a heart condition and a Pacemaker which made the surgery move involved as they need to relocate it to the other side of my body.) He couldn\'t be bothered with going with me for chemo, I had to get either my son, who was also fighting cancer, or a friend and her husband to drive a great distance, to take me. However, when our adult son had his chemo, my DH was present every time.</p><p>You didn\'t address your physical relationship. My DH has not touched me since I was Dx with BC. Not even before the mastectomy. This same thing happened with my parents. Mom lost one breast and my father never sleep with her again. I am not just talking about sex, but he never would sleep in the same bed. </p><p>My dh had a hernia surgery a couple weeks ago. I drove him to the hospital and home after. He got into the car and immediately called his mother then some other people, not even talking to me, except to watch the bumps as I was driving. When we got home he sat on the sofa and went right to his laptop. I mentioned (1/2 joking and trying to get a point across) the bathroom floor needed to be washed, he could wait until the next day. He came back with, \'I just had surgery\'. He never caught the point I was trying to make. There he sat with 2 tiny band aids, and back to his computer within about 2-3 hours after surgery...no problem. But when I had 13 incisions on my chest from my mastectomy, drains and everything else we go thru, he complained when I asked him to please wash the floor.</p><p>Men! I thought his surgery would make him more understanding of what I had been through. However it did not. By the way, my husband is a ships captain and gone for about a week or two then home for only a few days; You\'d think he\'d be more carrying. It could be the last time he sees me, but no sure luck.</p><p>I better post this before I reread it or I\'ll delete it.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Jean - Lumpectomy- 6/27/07, Chemo TC - 7/07, Mast/recon - 9/26/07 Chemo TC - 11/07 - 2 surgeries to correct infections, Exchange 3/5/07. repair surgery 5/2/08, Second exchange surgery wtih nipples Oct 3rd</div>",

The fear and denial they have is about not wanting to lose us, not know how much they need us...if in fact they love us - then need to put their crap on the table so it can be dealt with. Hiding, ignoring, drinking, escaping isn\'t going to help. Neither will walking out. My g/f and I had a very long discussion and I found out things I was not aware of, but she too also realized that her way of dealing was going to bring an end to our relationship. It was long over due and has put life back into our relationship that I wasn\'t sure was still there. I can only hope you guys can either find resolution and improve your situation...or learn your worth as a human being and do what you need to do to be happy.</p><p>I wish you the best...</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>life is short, play hard</div>",

        'content': "<p>Hi, Addison,</p><p>You must be so worried, and I\'m so sorry -- what a time it\'s been for you!</p><p>Grief takes time. She has lost a lot in a very short time, with all the fear and worry of the experience taking a toll as well. So often our loved ones assume when the treatment is over we\'ll be only relieved and fine again, but it\'s not that easy, or that quick. During the time of the diagnosis and treatment we\'re just trying to get through it. When it\'s over we have to sort out SOOOO much stuff. Grief and anger and a new sense of our own vulnerability. Not to mention sheer emotional exhaustion. And I\'ll say it again: grief. Give her time, support, understanding. Find some way to let her know it\'s okay with you if she takes her time about this, that her feelings are okay, that she\'s not dragging you down.</p><p>We don\'t exactly &quot;get over&quot; this. We do arrive at an understanding, and with support we get past the depression, but this experience changes us, and we need time to adjust. It\'s not all bad, but it\'s not easy.</p><p>Is there a cancer support group around? That can help, because she\'d have a chance to talk to others who are feeling the same things she is. Or, if her cancer center has a counselling service perhaps she\'d be willing to talk to someone there. For that matter there might even be a care-givers group, where you could share YOUR experience with others who are trying to deal with depressed or withdrawn loved ones. The helplessness and feeling of being on the outside looking in can be so daunting! Please do take good care of yourself -- she needs you!</p><p>Hugs to you both,<br />Binney</p>",

        'content': "<p>Hi Addison,&nbsp; I have a daughter who&nbsp;I think is a little younger than you might be if 05 means your graduation year.&nbsp; It is very hard on the children - even at your age, when their mom\'s have surgery like this to save their lives.&nbsp; Your mom is on medication and functioning well enough to be back at work - so this is actually a pretty good thing.&nbsp; If she were really dysfunctional, she might not be able to work.&nbsp; Will she be having further treatment, such as chemo or radiation?&nbsp; Or is the medical part done?&nbsp; Is she having reconstruction now?&nbsp; That is where a breast expander is placed under the chest muscle and skin, then slowly inflated in order to stretch the skin so far out that in a few months, she could have the expander taken out and an implant put in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many women find having the expander process going on to be very helpful after a mastectomy because they can see the mound of a breast growing everytime the plastic surgeon fills the expander with saline.&nbsp; If you could bring her to this site, she could make some posts, then gain access to the reconstruction site.&nbsp; There, she could see if reconstruction would be for her.&nbsp; It can boost her spirits to see the wonderful possibilities.&nbsp;There are&nbsp;breast reconstruction books you can buy on amazon.com.&nbsp; One is called something like Creating&nbsp;Aphrodite (I\'m not positive of the title but it is written by a woman plastic surgeon who does breast reconstruction). &nbsp;As&nbsp;your mom&nbsp;becomes more hopeful, you will feel better too.&nbsp;</p><p>Will your mom let you hug her gently?&nbsp; Getting hugged by&nbsp;my kids was important to me.&nbsp; It helped me feel whole and loved. &nbsp;I know it\'s hard and you feel shaky and need some support too.&nbsp; You are worrying about your mom and that is hard on you. There is a hole in the bridge right now, but you two being together will mean everything to her.&nbsp; It doesn\'t even matter if you are having a super great time.&nbsp; Just being together and trying to do the normal things is important.&nbsp; Maybe get your hair and nails done together.&nbsp; Maybe think of something, like both of you wearing a mom/daughter bracelet, or earrings.&nbsp; Go to the library together and just sit and read.&nbsp; Spring is coming, you could go for walks. &nbsp;Don\'t be surprised if after work, all she wants to do is stay home.&nbsp; Maybe watch TV, or read, or get on the computer, then go to bed.&nbsp; Just let her know you\'re there. In fact, if you have a problem and need to talk to her....it could very possibly help bring her around.&nbsp; Mom\'s always want to help their kids, and feeling needed by you, feeling like you need her advice, will help her!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She\'ll feel needed.&nbsp; Think of something to ask her advice about.&nbsp; Something you really need help or her guidance with.&nbsp; She\'ll feel good and useful knowing she has her wisdom to give you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask her to make a favorite dish you love.&nbsp;You could even give her a facial or do her makeup one afternoon.</p><p>Meanwhile...there is you.&nbsp; You are her daughter and probably feel very much like protecting her right now.&nbsp; That is a pretty big burden to put on yourself - but you know what?&nbsp;&nbsp; You are helping her more than you know just by caring enough to come here to ask questions.&nbsp; What can you do?&nbsp; Well...you could offer to do the grocery shopping and carry in the bags for her.&nbsp;You could unload the dishwasher because reaching up can be hard at first. &nbsp;You could bring her something you baked, or pick up something special for the two of you to eat.&nbsp; Or go out for lunch.&nbsp; Browse around on QVC and look at clothes - especially tops that have cowl necks that she can wear to help her from feeling self-conscious.&nbsp;Maybe buy a&nbsp;nice cami. &nbsp;Nothing fitted, more the bohemian or gypsy look.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a good daughter.&nbsp; Keep smiling, and helping her out.&nbsp; I know you have your own life going on, and now would be a good time to include her in your own thoughts about life.&nbsp; School or work, boyfriends, your girlfriends, hopes and dreams.&nbsp; Just start talking and let the conversation roll.&nbsp; Talk about planning a trip when&nbsp;you have some time together to take a little 3 day trip.&nbsp; She is feeling numb and changed.&nbsp; But you will always be her daughter and she will always love you even if she is feeling sort of far away at this time.&nbsp; Stick with her as you have been sweetie.&nbsp;It is hard to have mom be adrift like this, but just keep on loving her and being there for her.&nbsp; &nbsp;She will remember this time with you forever.</p>",

I tried to get off the Effexor and felt like absolute crap: brain zaps, hot flashes, irrational irritability. So I got back on it. Pronto. I\'m on an even smaller dose, but may up it after my colposcopy on Wednesday! So, if it helps without too many side effects I\'d stay on it. It does seem to help those lovely chemopause symptoms.

I would swear that I felt a difference after I took the first dose, even though they say it takes a while. Effexor is supposed to kick in more quickly than some, so I would think you would notice something by at least a week. I still get hot flashes, but they are more like warm flushes -- I notice I\'m warm but I don\'t have that &quot;I need to strip all my clothes off right now and jump in a pool of ice water&quot; like I did without the Effexor. Also, I noticed on another thread that you are taking it twice a day, which means you are not on the exteneded release formula. Do try to be consistent in taking in every 12 hours. And if it isn\'t working for you or you are getting side effects from it, talk to the doc about the ER. Some women have hated the regular and then done well with the ER. Others are fine with the regular. I\'m not sure there\'s a generic for the low dose ER, so some insurance plans make you &quot;fail&quot; at the regular before trying the ER.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 1/28/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 1/20 nodes, ER+, HER2-</div>",

        'content': "<p>Yeah! I am going through that now. One of my cousin who is in her late 30\'s was dx with ovarian cancer in 2007. She underwent surgery and chemo in Bangalore. Oct. 2008 she called me and informed that her tumor markers were very high and what should she do.I being cancer survivor of 13&nbsp;yrs she felt could guide her and I did. &nbsp;I guided her to the best gynecology - oncologist in Bangalore and told her to take his advice immediately. Also called up a few friends to help her out. I was part of voluntary helpers while in Bangalore and so have good contacts in hospitals and medical field there. But some stupid alternative medicine person promised total cure and ignoring all my suggestions they went to him. Obviously it failed and cancer started spreading and she is in great physical and emotional pain now. The hardest part for me to swallow here is that she was willing to go the doctor but it was her husband and brother who did not allow that. They forced her to follow them and she is the one who is suffering and dying. It is terrible to watch her suffer. She is at home and not on proper pain meds. She is just bones and skin. My heart goes out to her 4 kids. The eldest daughter is Farheena\'s age (13 yrs). That poor kid is suffering too along with her mother. Every time I visit her, I see her daughter sitting beside her and shedding silent tears. They do not like me interfering because they feel I am trying to waste their money on a person who is not going to survive. I am very angry and frustrated. She at least deserves to be in hospice and her daughter needs psychological help. The monster of her husband and brother are not listening... What do I do in such situation? </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Even a broken clock is right twice a day.. Never give up on anyone.

        'content': "<p>Thanks for those suggestions ladies. I live in rural India where there is no oncological hospitals. There is no hospice anywhere upto at least 200 miles of my village. The local doctors say it is their family decisions and can help only when called on to. The woman herself has no voice at all. She is illiterate and has been following orders for years and doesn\'t know what else she can do. I tried talking sense into her when it was possible for her to stand up talk but she wouldn\'t. Yesterday I saw her feet were totally swollen and full of blisters. She is mostly throwing up everything she takes in. The husband is confusing me. He had been a good husband to her all along for so many years. They never had any problems in their lives until cancer took control of it. He must have felt that allopathy treatment did not work for her&nbsp;as there was recurrance, so he may have resorted to alternative medicines (Ayurveda is famous in India but does nothing to cancer) . He feels the allopathy meds are only after his money. She has people caring for her though. Her daughter has not left her side for a month now. She is attending to her every needs. She comes from a big joint family. 7 brothers and 1 sister. Off course her mother is taking care of her too. No music though. I would have had a showdown with her family if they ill treated her but it is just a case of wrong belief. Her elder brother mislead her husband and he in turn took advantage of his advice. I have lost my Mom and sister to cancer but they did not suffer like this. Her husband knows I am upset with what he is doing and so tries to avoid his family contact with me. He feels I will poison his kids and wife\'s mind against him. Stupid. Like Jessica says, no one should be given up on.. Atleast she has love and attention. Off course her husband is there at times too, being very loving, feeding her junk food and talking sweet words.</p><p>I am disgusted and horrified with the situation. I am looking out for some NGO\'s who can interfere. Pray I will find one...........before it is too late.

Not knowing if my life will end soon, I did work out issues with him and we all are together again upon return from Iraq.. He came back with his own ptsd and is negative alll the time.&nbsp; He c ritiques me always and I am physically not the same women I was before diagnosis,&nbsp; My bones are constantly fracturing due to chemo even though Dana Farber states this is not true but other orthopedic Dr.s say it is directly due to this.. I was a strong independent women, I was a full time Officer of the Law a Cop&nbsp; only 2 females on a department of 125 men.&nbsp; I bought and owned real estate I had own trucking company, plowed as I live in New England.. I had to retire from my identity, Career, as my husband sabotaged my job due to medications I was on during and shortly after treatments this was why we were getting divorced.. as he did not have a Career he felt good about I handed him my trucking business a small 2 truck hauling but a business that generated money.... His family disowned me when we were going through seperation.&nbsp; John deployed I made sure our son always saw his Yia Yia grandmother etc even paid for her to fly out to california to meet the plane at Port Hyunamne? For the year John deployed we were best of friends again.. Minute we all came home together as John and I had chosen to work through the crap for our sons sake&nbsp; ( I was a product of divorce and I did not want my only son to go through this as who knowa how long life is after Cancer) any way I needed help with cleaning my home and feeling not so depressed and I googled my feelings and this site popped up.&nbsp; I have never felt so vindicated after reading great unfortunatly material.&nbsp; I even took a bath climbed the stairs watched my son play a game and actually not only joined by am composing on site... God I thank all of you for sharing your emotionally hard truthful comments this is the best I have ever felt reading something to do with Breast Cancer as I usually stay clear of it,&nbsp; Many of the attitudes and happy people make me feel worse, synical or that im just using it as a crutch as I was told i a meeting I went to never returned I need to clean my house I need to go outside, I need to be part of life again, I have been waiting to die and preparing for my sons financial future and not I guess Living people close do not say it but I know they think that I should be so much more grateful for this 2nd chance&nbsp; and I am but it has devestated me along with so many other of lifes hard knocks I thank you for any advice in just gettig off the couc h and not the usual anyone can be hit by a bus, or put on a happy music to motivate you.. thank you Julia g 8199</p>",

I joined this site just a couple of days ago - this is <span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>my very first post</span>. In March, I hit my 5 year anniversary of completion of all invasive treatment. So, to mark that milestone &amp; feeling like I\'m now finally ready to - hopefully - &quot;give back&quot; to others ... share, help, support, encourage... here I am...</p><p>I was moved by your message, Julia - and, my heart goes out to you. Although we all have different circumstances within our individual lives, we know &amp; understand exactly how &amp; what you\'re feeling. But, I think you are already on the right path - you are absolutely correct in that, just because we\'re in remission/NED (no evidence of disease) does NOT mean we should all be simply waiting to die. When that time comes, frankly, the vast majority of us will gain entrance to heaven via something else (like plain, old age-related) - NOT breast cancer.</p><p>You have a young son; and, you obviously love him, very much. Invest in yourself. Do everything within your power to take the very best care of YOURSELF. That is your own personal &quot;insurance policy&quot; - the most important and best thing you can do in order to be around for him as long as possible. Raise him, watch him grow, know that he\'ll be an adult man someday able to take care of himself. Although family is important, try to minimize &quot;toxic&quot; relationships. It\'s hard, I know - but, at least try.</p><p>I\'ve been waiting nearly 5 years to &quot;get my life back&quot;... Finally now realizing &amp; accepting (the accepting part is key, really) that my &quot;prior&quot; life is gone, done. I think I\'ve been in mourning, grieving for it. The heck with that! I am ALIVE. This is my &quot;now&quot; life - I\'ll take it, and am grateful for it. Even with adjustments.</p><p>You\'re already &quot;getting there&quot; - and, it\'s not easy. Again, take really good care of yourself.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Be hopeful, be well...</div>",

        'content': "<p>Barbe,&nbsp; the mortality stats that I\'ve seen for Canada are quite different than what you said.&nbsp; In actual fact, my understanding is that 32% of Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer will pass away from breast cancer, not 50%.&nbsp; So that\'s a 68% survival rate.&nbsp; Here\'s what the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation says:</p><p><em>One in nine (11%) Canadian women is expected to develop breast cancer during her lifetime (this means by age 90).&nbsp; Only one in every 28 Canadian women will die from breast cancer. This means that about two-thirds of the women diagnosed with breast cancer in Canada will live through it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><a href=\'http://www.cbcf.org/breastcancer/bc_whatbc_bc.asp\'>http://www.cbcf.org/breastcancer/bc_whatbc_bc.asp</a> </p><p>You can\'t calculate BC mortality by comparing the number of women diagnosed in any one year with the number of women who pass away in that same year.&nbsp;There is no relationship between those two numbers. &nbsp;The women who pass away may have been diagnosed 5, 10, 15&nbsp;or even 20 years earlier.&nbsp; </p><p>And here\'s another source of data.&nbsp; Canadian survival rates are about 1% lower than U.S. survival rates.&nbsp; So what are the U.S. survival rates?&nbsp; The most comprehensive information on this is&nbsp;the SEER 1975-2003 report.&nbsp; For those diagnosed with invasive cancer (i.e. this excludes DCIS), the 20 year survival rate is 52.5%.&nbsp; But keep in mind that this survival rate&nbsp;represents women diagnosed between 1975 and 1979.&nbsp; This was before Tamoxifen, before the AIs, before Herceptin.&nbsp; The 10 year survival rate for this group of women (those diagnosed between 1975 and 1979) was 62.8%.&nbsp; This compares to the&nbsp;most current 10 year survival rate (for women diagnosed in 1993 - still a long time ago) of&nbsp;78.9% -&nbsp;an improvement of 16.1 points.&nbsp; These women (the 1993 group) had a 5 year survival rate of 86.1%.&nbsp; The most current 5 year survival rate is 89. 8%, for women diagnosed in 1998.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another 3.7 point improvement.&nbsp; So this would suggest that with no further improvements, a reasonable&nbsp;estimate of the 20 year survival rate would be about 62%.&nbsp; This still doesn\'t take into account any treatment improvements since 1998 and or the fact that approx. 20% of all new diagnoses are DCIS, with a survival rate of 98% - 99%.&nbsp; That alone would move the 20 year survival rate up to 69%.&nbsp; <a href=\'http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2003/results_merged/sect_04_breast.pdf\'>http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2003/results_merged/sect_04_breast.pdf</a>&nbsp;(see page 11)</p><p>As for Dr. Love\'s book, I&nbsp;never recommend it because I think it scares the c**p out of too many women.&nbsp; And while I of course acknowledge that she\'s the expert, I disagree with quite a few things that she says.&nbsp; As for her comment that 30% - 40% of node negative women will eventually develop mets, that\'s simply not possible with the&nbsp;survival rates where they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a while ago there was a post about a quote something like this, and it turned out that there was an interpretation issue.&nbsp; I don\'t know if that\'s the case here, but&nbsp;this quote sure doesn\'t sound right.&nbsp;</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Dx 9/15/2005, DCIS 6cm+ Grade 3 w/ IDC microinvasion, Stage I, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR-</div>",

But I had the entire reaction with Taxotere after only 3 drops on the 2nd treatment. However, there IS another form of Taxol that they CAN change you to if you have a reaction. Apparently the allergy reaction is from the solvent for the Taxol which is called Cremophor. The newer drug, Abraxane, is a form of Taxol delivered with microalbumin particles instead. As it is more expensive, you have to have failed Taxol or Taxotere before your physician makes the change, I think.I got through all of the remaining treatments with Abraxane. I don\'t know but it may help with your worries if you know that there is another option that can be pursued if necessary.

I feel so ashamed to even complain here&nbsp;because so many other women have much more serious problems (with family and finances as well as BC) but still I can\'t seem to get out of this &quot;endure&quot; mode.&nbsp;The problem is&nbsp;that I have so many more doctor appointments ahead of me - a colonoscopy April 21st - surgery to fix the foob on April 21st and surgery to&nbsp;repair the abdominal hernia and remove the gall bladder on July 1st. Thus my usual &quot;in the moment&quot; enjoyment of life has disappeared - I am going through the motions. Work is a great distractor - fortunately I have a job I enjoy - helping&nbsp;kids and teachers&nbsp;with computer issues is fun and mind-engrossing. It helped me years ago when my dad was dying of astrocytoma (brain cancer) and I find it helping me again. Still this is not r<strong>eally </strong>living........I come home and feel so down and feel I have nothing to look forward to - the summer will arrive with me back in the hospital for a week with abdominal drains - I\'ll need another 6 to 8 weeks to recuperate - with the unknown&nbsp;questions and fear - will I get MRSA&nbsp;again? Will I feel more pain after the mesh is placed? Will my digestive system go completely bonkers after the gall bladder comes out? Will I be sorry that I didn\'t insist on having my uterus and ovaries removed? Dark scary questions - the road ahead of me is so dark and scary - and I have lost so much joy in my life. What makes me continue&nbsp;going through the motions&nbsp;is the joy&nbsp;my children bring me.........all my hopes and dreams and future lie with them. I need to endure for their sake.........put on my lipstick, &quot;pull up my big-girl panties&quot; (as a sign in my <strong>former</strong> onc\'s office said - not a very upbeat thing to read while you\'re getting chemo, notice it was my FORMER onc\'s office)...........and just go on, one step in front of the other, going through the motions, and holding onto my faith in God that soon He\'ll get me out of this darkness back into the light of living. I feel like I\'m in a dark dirty tunnel and the only light is a teany glimmer at the end - so I push forward, enduring - hoping that this dark dank place doesn\'t infiltrate my mind or soul.<div class=\'post_sig\'>3/3/08 Right-side mastectomy with immediate muscle-sparing free tram; 3/9/08 Developed abdominal MRSA staph infection and hernia<br />Dx 2/5/2008, IDC, &lt;1cm, Stage Ib, Grade 1, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+</div>",

        'content': "<p>Thank you all so much! <strong>Sue</strong> I have never been to a therapist - it\'s something I\'ve been thinking about. I miss the nurse who followed me every few weeks last year (believe it or not she worked for the insurance company!) She was such a great listener and had great advice - she helped me get my hospital reports and switch PS\'s and oncs. So if I do see a therapist, I want someone who understands breast cancer........but on another level, I don\'t feel like adding yet ANOTHER BC-related appointment to my calendar! I\'m also aware that I\'ll feel so much better when I get rid of this cough and start feeling better. So I\'m in a holding pattern for a while. <strong>Baywatcher</strong> you put it well - negative energy - I keep hoping once I get these surgeries over with and my body feels better I\'ll start having more positive energy - andI hope you\'ll be able to regain some positive energy too. <strong>Ina</strong> thanks for the good news about the colonscopy......I\'m not really worried about it (although that little bit of cancer fear is always there)......it\'s just another stupid yucky procedure to get over with. I need to be sure there aren\'t any problems in that area before my big abdominal surgery in July. I\'ve never had a colonoscopy - and at 54, it\'s overdue. It was one of the first things they told me to do after releasing me from the hospital last year, I was so surprised - made me realize that the doctors know there is a heightened risk for colon cancer after breast cancer. <strong>Hopefor30</strong> I haven\'t had any delibitating gall bladder attacks - just this very annoying pain in my right side that comes and goes. I\'m sorry you got an infection in the hospital, but it gives me hope that I can get through more surgeries like you without any more problems! And <strong>Pam</strong> I\'ve been thinking about you and wondering how you\'re feeling. Thanks for sharing your feelings - I think you\'re smart to think about waiting another month for your surgery so you can enjoy the summer a little. You\'ve been through so much already - I hope all\'s well with your heart function. I think the most depressing thing is to not be able to enjoy the good weather coming up.........to anticipate being an <strong>invalid</strong> in the summer is such a bummer! <img title=\'Frown\' src=\'/javascripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-frown.gif\' alt=\'Frown\' />You deserve some quality good times - and more business!

It is a very popular notion in our culture today that if you have a positive attitude you can get rid of your cancer, or that you never get it or that it doesn\'t return. If you think about it, that notion is truly an oxymoron. An oxymoron means two things that don\'t go together-like &quot;jumbo shrimp.&quot; The reason I call it that is to think about telling somebody what is the worst news of his or her lifetime and then ask them to be positive just doesn\'t make sense. Having bad feelings and down days is neither good nor bad-it\'s just normal. The only people we ask to have a positive attitude at all times are people who have had cancer. I can be miserable all day long and nobody is going to reprimand me about being positive. You only \'have\' to be positive if you have cancer.</span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Having that philosophy or notion or belief is like living in tyranny. What it does to you as a patient is that on days that you are down or depressed or sad or anxious or worried-which is normal-you will feel even worse because you have accepted the notion that those are bad feelings. You need to work hard to get rid of that notion. It is not fair. It is putting a burden on the patient, while it serves many good purposes for the people who are saying it. If you are going to be happy and positive all of the time, then I don\'t have to worry about you. It also leads me to believe that if I am positive I will be fine. The philosophy serves everyone except the patient.</span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>You need to know that people will tell you that you need to be positive. You need to be prepared in how to handle that comment coming at you, and that is something that you want to do in a way that is comfortable for you. What I think works is that when someone tells you to be positive, suggest they walk in your shoes first. And inform them that when people speak to you that way, it\'s really not helpful. You need to protect yourself as much as possible from that theory because it is burdensome and hurtful. A bad attitude will cause only one thing and that is a bad day. The best reason for having a good attitude is that on that day you will enjoy yourself. But neither the good nor the bad attitude will affect the illness. It will affect the quality of the day that you are having.</span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Your fear is just the natural outcome of having this diagnosis. It will not cause the cancer to come back. I work with a thousand women a year and I have never met one that doesn\'t suffer from fear, either enormous or very enormous. It\'s normal. Not bad, just normal. It will have no impact on the course of the cancer.</span></p><p>I\'m approaching my anniversary date, and nearly a year later the bc and LE have impacted my ability to work, my stamina, my outlook, and I get upset with myself that &quot;I\'m stuck&quot;.

Its ok to have bad days, we had them BEFORE the dx; besides, it take way to much energy to be positive and happy all the time. </p><p>Swim, endure is a good word for it. Eventually, some day things will seem better, not quite so gloomy. I think that everyone gets there eventually but when is different for everyone. Being in active treatment, having appointments and surgeries makes it hard to forget, hard to settle into any kind of routine, of feeling settled.&nbsp; Just hold on to the fact that while its very small, there IS a light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; I don\'t think its about &quot;being positive&quot; but more about having hope and being hopeful. Sharing with others, having a cup of coffee, even if its a virtual cup here, makes it much better.

I\'m really glad the BC part is over, got an all clear yesterday.. I\'ve Endured... Am Enduring. Some days are harder than others... so I try to take them one day at a time. That\'s how I get thru. My journey has been much like climbing out of a tunnel.</p><p>Since my dx, I\'ve had; An Appendectomy, fell down 5 times hurting my back. A cystogram test for multiple UTIs, a Colonoscopy, (Colitis), an Endoscope. For&nbsp;the back pain, I\'ve endured&nbsp;SIXTEEN epidural injections in my lumbar spine, yet continuing unbelieveable&nbsp;pain&nbsp;and finally, neck surgery where they removed a hierniated disk, replaced it with a \'cage\' and screwed a metal plate into my neck bones above and below. Bone growth within a year should provide fusion of these bones. Oh yeah, and I lost my job of 18 years, had to go on COBRA and have now applied for SS Disability. All in less than 2 years. </p><p>I understand pain. I also understand depression and know that it\'s really hard to admit that one actually has depression, but getting help for it is VITAL. I know that tunnel is&nbsp;scary &amp; dark. Hang on to the light, thank God every DAY that the light is still there because that means you are still living and still have a chance for better days. Take whatever steps possible to keep that light in your sight. Adding another med is really no biggie, but accepting it\'s help is a big deal, and it takes time, like everything else we do, weeks of time just slipping by. Better, I think, to keep climbing up towards the light. </p><p>I lost my Joy too. Didn\'t really appreciate it when it was there. Sure do miss it now. I miss my life. I had goals and objectives and challenges and I managed them well. Now I challenge myself to get my @ss&nbsp;out of bed everyday. I challenge myself to eat lunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it\'s very lonely a lot. </p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 6/6/2007, DCIS, 5cm, Stage I, Grade 1, /0 nodes, ER+</div>",

We celebrated by taking photos, laughing and presenting the techs with a final chocolate gift. Afterwards II took another longer walk by a creek looking up at our beautiful Mt. Tamalpias here in Marin. I thanked the universive that I was alive and stronger than I thought to make it through 11 months of treatment.&nbsp; We are all amazing women!!!</p><p>A week later my excitement has shifted to exhaustion. I feel completely depleated. And I am quite teary now. I will wake up crying my eyes out for no reason at all. What is this about? I think my body is letting out a great big sigh...my hormones are rocking...and I am really tired. My joints ache everywhere and I haven\'t started the Tamoxafin yet? I just keep telling myself to be cool and give my body time to catch up and heal.

You are entitled to have all the grief reactions that you have. You are in the middle of a rotten time--barely three weeks post op, and likely facing radiation. You\'ve joined a club you would never want to join. Also, the hormone shifts are likely making it all worse. It\'s terrible that your sister has bc also, but her problems don\'t negate yours.</p><p>It\'s a complicated grief that we feel, and at the beginning, you\'ve just overwhelmed.</p><p>I\'m going to be redundant here, and post the positive attitude quote, from the ask the expert:</p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'><a href=\'http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp\'><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp</span></a></span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'><a href=\'http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp\'><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>reebird: Can you cause your cancer to come back just by being afraid that it will?<br />Answer -Rosalind Kleban, L.C.S.W.: I am glad that this question was raised, because I\'m sure that is on the mind of the majority of people. It is a very popular notion in our culture today that if you have a positive attitude you can get rid of your cancer, or that you never get it or that it doesn\'t return. If you think about it, that notion is truly an oxymoron. An oxymoron means two things that don\'t go together-like \'jumbo shrimp.\' The reason I call it that is to think about telling somebody what is the worst news of his or her lifetime and then ask them to be positive just doesn\'t make sense. Having bad feelings and down days is neither good nor bad-it\'s just normal. The only people we ask to have a positive attitude at all times are people who have had cancer. I can be miserable all day long and nobody is going to reprimand me about being positive. You only \'have\' to be positive if you have cancer. </span></span></a></span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Having that philosophy or notion or belief is like living in tyranny. What it does to you as a patient is that on days that you are down or depressed or sad or anxious or worried-which is normal-you will feel even worse because you have accepted the notion that those are bad feelings. You need to work hard to get rid of that notion. It is not fair. It is putting a burden on the patient, while it serves many good purposes for the people who are saying it. If you are going to be happy and positive all of the time, then I don\'t have to worry about you. It also leads me to believe that if I am positive I will be fine. The philosophy serves everyone except the patient. </span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>You need to know that people will tell you that you need to be positive. You need to be prepared in how to handle that comment coming at you, and that is something that you want to do in a way that is comfortable for you. What I think works is that when someone tells you to be positive, suggest they walk in your shoes first. And inform them that when people speak to you that way, it\'s really not helpful. You need to protect yourself as much as possible from that theory because it is burdensome and hurtful. A bad attitude will cause only one thing and that is a bad day. The best reason for having a good attitude is that on that day you will enjoy yourself. But neither the good nor the bad attitude will affect the illness. It will affect the quality of the day that you are having. </span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Your fear is just the natural outcome of having this diagnosis. It will not cause the cancer to come back. I work with a thousand women a year and I have never met one that doesn\'t suffer from fear, either enormous or very enormous. It\'s normal. Not bad, just normal. It will have no impact on the course of the cancer.</span></p><p><span>Kira</span></p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage Ib, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

There was a guy sitting at the next table and I was tempted to smack him just for being male!&nbsp; My DH said if men had to go through this hormonal craziness, there\'d be a cure for it.</p><p>Anyway, I appreciate all who have posted about your experiences and with words of encouragement.&nbsp; They mean the world to me. &nbsp;</p><p>Makraz and Janet - I have been using the Ativan, though I\'m concerned about addiction.&nbsp; Maybe I shouldn\'t worry about that so much....at most I take a total of 0.5 mg a day in two half-pills.&nbsp; It does help with the anxiety and allows me to sleep.&nbsp; I\'ll check with my doc about taking it daily at that level.</p><p>Deb - thanks for sharing your experience with lexapro.&nbsp; I think I also saw that you\'re in the May rads group?&nbsp; If so, I\'m there, too.</p><p>Sunrise, while I haven\'t been writing about my feelings, I\'m trying to be more conscious about them and what\'s going through my head or happening around me when things start to feel off-kilter.&nbsp; It\'s helping a bit. I also have my daily affirmations and guided imagery.&nbsp; Thanks for sharing.</p><p>Trixie, I do like the hurricane analogy.&nbsp; I\'m still waiting for the calm, but I know it\'s coming. And I\'m steadily acknowledging all that I\'m going through and letting myself feel battered a bit.&nbsp; I can\'t pretend to be strong all the time, I just don\'t have it in me.&nbsp; It feels good to let go.</p><p>&nbsp;God bless. </p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 2/8/2009, IDC, &lt;1cm, Stage Ib, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

Years ago a doctor told me that 2 weeks of unbroken depression ( nothing gives you any joy..at all...not even Cherry Garcia or your favorite movie...) creates a chemical situation.</p><p>&nbsp;I did not have the money for medication at the time and was exasperated with myself. To focus on ANYTHING seemed to help, so I took out my childhood guitar...and got a beginner\'s book..and just did that for a half hour or so every time I was very cranky. I had to completely focus on learning because I had forgotten everything I ever knew about playing. Ten days later, I was in a much better place. The DR. said that exercising that part of my brain may have helped shift things for me in a good way and that music is helpful.</p><p>I played like crap... but I say this to suggest finding something to do stuff that you have an interest in and like: crochet , read, walk a dog from a shelter , make a terrific cake, throw crabapples at your loud neighbors.Immersion in an activity can shake something good loose...because you are in the moment and not in the storyline of cancer stuff and the fallout.</p><p>If this does not work: BETTER LIVING BY CHEMICALS!!!</p><p>Moogie&nbsp;</p>",

I had a left mastectomy and then found out I might be HER2 positive after all (was negative on biopsy) but after waiting 2 weeks found out I was HER2 negative. then more waiting for the oncotype&nbsp; which was only 13, 8% so I\'m not doing chemo. So why don\'t I feel more relieved? I guess I\'ve been thinking about nothing but breast cancer and worried so long about what chemo I\'ll need, my brain doesn\'t know where to put all that worry now. I really haven\'t been that worried about recurrence but now have moved on to worrying about that. I registered at a grocery store for the race for the cure and got so emotional I had to walk around and cry before I could go back to work. I feel like such a wimp! After all, I didn\'t even have to do chemo and lose my hair! I have to stop the prozac I was taking since it makes the tamoxifen less effective (don\'t want that!) I\'ll probably try citalopram. </p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 3/5/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage Ib, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

        'content': "<p>I guess I am going to be the (somewhat) dissenting voice here. I have really been through the whole breast cancer journey these past 18 months with surgery, chemo, radiation and tamoxifen. And with 2 teenaged girls with their own anxieties about my health. And with a spouse who ended up needing mood stabilizing medications (with obvious improvement). So I am not totally opposed to psychotropic medications. But they are not the answer to everyone, just as other therapies do not fit everyone.Having worked in the medical field for 30 years with chronically ill patients, I see physicians readily write prescriptions for antidepressants because they genuinely want to help but they don\'t know other means for doing so. But thereare risks attached to these medications- they are changing the chemistry of the brain which may make it difficult to readjust later. Thereare no really objective measures to measure their efficacy. There has been a large placebo effect in some of the clinical trials with those results held back by the drug companies when they are promoting these medications to physicians and with advertising to the public. </p><p>I have had many days when I broke into tears for no apparent reason since this cancer journey started. However, I have made steady progress with the help of a counselor with cognitive behavior therapy, by finding a great breast cancer support group, by becoming more involved at church, by spending time with family and friends, by volunteering. Some other things that I have found helpful are meditation, journaling, music, exerciseand massage. I have tried to combat these feelings in the same way that I fought the cancer during treatment last year. And it is usually successful. During the sad times, I have accepted that I just have some mourning to do about health issues and life changes. </p><p>In fact, you may be one of the people that benefit from antidepressants. But there are other options for many people also. I hope this did not offend you in any way because that is not my hope/intent. I will keep you in my prayers!!</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Janet<br />Dx 9/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIb, Grade 2, 4/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+</div>",

That said, I think that even the medical establishment agrees nowadays that talk therapy (aka counseling) in conjunction with antidepressants is the MOST helpful for major depression.

        'content': "<p>Hello Janet. I was just wondering if you - or anyone else reading this - has any advice. My mother, 60, was diagnosed with stage IIa estrogen receptive (I think) cancer. While my details might be a little off, I know the bottom line from her oncologist is excellent prognosis, no reduced life expectancy or quality. One year on and she remains cancer free. Despite having this confirmed only a week ago, her mental health remains awful. She hasn\'t had to work for some time and is becoming quite neurotic. In fact she is becoming neurotic about becoming neurotic, and constantly worries she\'s having a meltdown and is going to be committed or something, despite being assured she displays plenty of rationality. She was prescribed ativan for the guts of 10 months (something I\'m told was far too long and should never have been done??) and has been off it a month. I believe the withdrawal symptoms can involve all sorts of neurosis and anxiety. She agrees having time on her hands is bad and yet she refuses to get involved in any support groups or anything. She has had three CBT sessions but says its useless and has given up. Same with yoga. My dad is at the end of his rope too, having been utterly understanding and helpful for a year. She seems incapable of taking on the good news or recognizing how much worse off so many other are. Crucially, I think, she says she is still most angry about the cancer. There is little sign of acceptance or internalization of the good news. Any suggestions? Anyone? We\'re all rapidly running out of answers. Best of luck to everyone battling this right pain in the arse of a disease!</p>",

Your body rapidly gets used to it and then it takes more to get the same response. Also the withdrawal symptoms are the same as the symptoms of anxiety, shakiness etc. Sometimes it takes being on an antidepressant in order for the talk therapy to work. Talk therapy is very effective but it is hard work, takes a lot of motivation and effort and is not a quick fix. Encourage her to see a psychiatrist who specializes in anxiety and depressive disorders. The psychiatrist will encourage her to continue talk therapy. She may need to try a new therapist.

All I want to say is you know what I don\'t feel good! Or you must be so happy this is all behind you. WHAT??? I live in fear everyday this is going to come back, I have permenate nerve damage, I just finished with Herceptin weekly, I am on Tomoxifen, and a big you know what needle that gets stuck in my butt every 3 months till I have a hysterectomy, never mind all the joint aches and hormonal flares and lets not forget the 10hr surgery I have up coming for a Diep. God get a clue. But I just smile and say Thanks!!!! Sometimes I feel like I am going to explode. They think once your hair grows back that your done!!! They don\'t want to hear about all the other stuff we all need to go through or deal with, we are suppose to go back to normal.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We just did a huge benefit for one of my goodfriends who was just diagnoised with BC this past week-end. We live in a small community but we raised 35,000.00 for her and I could not be happier for her. I had a few people come up to me and say &quot;Does this make you feel bad cause you didn\'t have a benefit?&quot; God No it does not bother me. #1 I was asked if I wanted one but declined thankfully. But I can\'t believe people have the gall to even ask me that. I was their for my friend and I am so pleased that we raised that much for her cause she is really going to need it. But some people just don\'t think before they say something.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to let everyone know and I really wish I had the guts to do it but I know I never would, that NO my journey is not over or will it ever be over for me and my family this has changed our lives forever! I will be in TX for the rest of my life thanks to my hormone status. And I will have reminders for the rest of my life thanks to Chemo. I will live on numerous pills for the rest of my life.And I hold no illussions that this won\'t come back due to my stage and diagnoisis its not never its just when!!!

        'content': "<p>You are all so right!! My problem comes from my own family. I went through the bilateral mast andchemo with flying colors. I was a \'brave girl\'. After the initial shock of diagnosis and the many, many tears, I just did what I had to do and tried not to upset the family routine. That was my big mistake! Now, I am just supposed to be just like I always was, but I can\'t. I can barely keep up with my job. I don\'t sleep well anymore at all. I am just so very tired. I honestly don\'t feel good. I am tired of chasing the American dream and worrying about \'what I look like\'. This whole experience has aged me beyond belief. The lines in my face are deeper, my hair is thin, and I look like Uncle Fester with the circles under my eyes. I am no longer the multi-tasker that I used to be. If I do one thing and I do it well, I am pretty darn proud of myself. But, every day, I get up and trudge through the day smiling as if none of this matters. I wear my foobs so that I look like I have always looked. And, I hide behind the false smiles and the false boobs. Some day though, Imay just lose it and let everybody know that I am not what I appear to be.</p><p>I think back to before I was diagnosed, and no, I do not think I would have understood all the emotions and body changes that happen with a cancer diagnosis. That is why I still come here almost three years out from diagnosis. You guys get it! I can validate my feelings and know that they are real. I canbe among my own kind, so to speak. I do get so tired of pretending everything is okay all the time.</p><p>Cheryl </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Bilateral mast/no recon; 4 rounds of AC, tamoxifen<br />Dx 5/15/2006, ILC, &lt;1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

        'content': "<p>I don\'t know if I\'m going to be able to articulate this very well, but here goes. HA! First, I acknowledge that I haven\'t had as scary or life-changing an experience as so many others have, but I certainly have had my times of anxiety and fear and resentment and... I also get comments about how well I handled things, and thank goodness it\'s all over. Well, I DID think it was all over after my first bout of DCIS but here I am again with a new diagnosis, with all that implies.</p><p>Here\'s where I\'m going to have trouble making sense, I think - I think it\'s only fair for our loved ones to really understand our journey. And the thoughtless or clueless can use some education. So I try to be open about what really is going on in my head. If someone says, &quot;Gosh, you were so brave,&quot; I gently say, &quot;Well, not always....&quot; and then offer some insight for them. Just a quick statement, not a lecture. Then if they want to honestly talk more, we do. If not, we move on.</p><p>I don\'t want to wait till I\'m all pissed off and take someone\'s head off. I want to keep my own sanity by being open and honest. And it\'s also true that I like to be acknowledged when I do manage to be strong. But I think it\'s OK for others to see that there is a price with all that. </p><p>And at bottom, I kind of want people to know what it\'s REALLY like in case, god forbid, it happens to them. So that if THEY feel they can\'t be brave and upbeat all the time, like I supposedly was, that\'s normal! </p><p>And honestly, I don\'t want to have to be responsible for keeping everyone else\'s spirits up ALL the time. Mostly, yes, I do want to keep IT from leaching into my home life. But there are days I need to be very real with my husband, and he just has to go there with me (and I must say, he does - he\'s been so great). And I need to be real with my sister, because our mom had BC, too (18-year survivor!), and my sister may be next. (Hell, ANYONE could be next; a friend of mine was dx with Stage 1 IDC a week after my last dx.) For her, I definitely want to demonstrate that you keep on going despite the fear. It\'s working for all of us thus far. I don\'t make it All About Cancer very often - but when a dose of reality from me is appropriate, I provide it.</p><p>Certainly those who say, &quot;Thank god it\'s over&quot; WANT it to be over, because they love us and they are frightened for us, and for our kids, spouses, parents, friends...and themselves.&nbsp;But they need to know. I\'m not one to be comfortable breaking down in front of someone but I AM OK with opening up and sharing some of my internal journey. So I like to do that in bits and pieces along the way and not bottle it up. I believe that, for me, it\'s beneficial - and they can learn something, too. And if someone can\'t handle it that,honestly, is not my problem. I had to get tough; they can, too.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>2005 DCIS left breast/2009 DCIS right breast, both Stage 0, Grade 3 with comedonecrosis, ER-/PR-, HER2?

You want to talk about a ignorant SOB!! I was so shocked I could not say anything for a minute till he kept going. People sitting around him whom know my situation were shell shocked.

He goes on to say well I just don\'t understand why you would cut your long blonde hair, I had decided I had enough and people were very uncomfortable. I said well you know what I just gone through Hell for the last year and a half due to CANCER! Thank-you very much. He is such a ignorant person he didn\'t even have the senses to say gee sorry about that, he made the lame excuse he thought I was someone else.

She is so numb the next time I talked with her was Xmas which was 2 months later and she goes oh its so nice to hear you talking so positive again. I really wanted to wrap my hands around her throat and say did you not understand anything about this whole thing. I still have not seen them!

It is a very popular notion in our culture today that if you have a positive attitude you can get rid of your cancer, or that you never get it or that it doesn\'t return. If you think about it, that notion is truly an oxymoron. An oxymoron means two things that don\'t go together-like &quot;jumbo shrimp.&quot; The reason I call it that is to think about telling somebody what is the worst news of his or her lifetime and then ask them to be positive just doesn\'t make sense. Having bad feelings and down days is neither good nor bad-it\'s just normal. The only people we ask to have a positive attitude at all times are people who have had cancer. I can be miserable all day long and nobody is going to reprimand me about being positive. You only \'have\' to be positive if you have cancer. </span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Having that philosophy or notion or belief is like living in tyranny. What it does to you as a patient is that on days that you are down or depressed or sad or anxious or worried-which is normal-you will feel even worse because you have accepted the notion that those are bad feelings. You need to work hard to get rid of that notion. It is not fair. It is putting a burden on the patient, while it serves many good purposes for the people who are saying it. If you are going to be happy and positive all of the time, then I don\'t have to worry about you. It also leads me to believe that if I am positive I will be fine. The philosophy serves everyone except the patient. </span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>You need to know that people will tell you that you need to be positive. You need to be prepared in how to handle that comment coming at you, and that is something that you want to do in a way that is comfortable for you. What I think works is that when someone tells you to be positive, suggest they walk in your shoes first. And inform them that when people speak to you that way, it\'s really not helpful. You need to protect yourself as much as possible from that theory because it is burdensome and hurtful. A bad attitude will cause only one thing and that is a bad day. The best reason for having a good attitude is that on that day you will enjoy yourself. But neither the good nor the bad attitude will affect the illness. It will affect the quality of the day that you are having. </span></p><p><span class=\'Apple-style-span\'>Your fear is just the natural outcome of having this diagnosis. It will not cause the cancer to come back. I work with a thousand women a year and I have never met one that doesn\'t suffer from fear, either enormous or very enormous. It\'s normal. Not bad, just normal. It will have no impact on the course of the cancer.</span></p><p><a href=\'http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp\'>http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp</a></p><p>&nbsp;I have a friend (?) who told me that she couldn\'t handle my &quot;negative vibes&quot;--so don\'t.

Friday morning my boss called me in to tell me how poorly she thinks I\'m doing my work.</p><p> I worked through chemo but ended up being off work for a month last summer after surgery led to infections. When I finally got back to work full-time I had more doctor appointments because of damage to my heart. I spent days in a fog and I KNOW I wasn\'t giving my top performance at work or anywhere else. My chemopause brought on soaking hot flashes that hit me every 20 minutes - day and night (no sleep at night and a big distraction all day long). It took months but with gabapentin the hot flashes are under control and I\'m starting to feel normal again. </p><p>So here I am. I recently had help from two other employees to get caught up. But all my work is on time now and NOW the boss is complaining that I fell so far behind. Of course I was behind. No assistance was offered even though I had permission to take time off for treatment. Help was only ordered once I\'d gotten behind on everything.&nbsp; </p><p>Caught up in all this is the personal issue of me feeling left out. For months the rest of my colleagues (8 of them) have gone off repeatedly with the boss for a coffee break. I\'m in my office but I\'m located at the opposite end of the hall (15 feet away). It really did hurt to find out that everyone had left without saying a word to me. After a while it was routine but still uncomfortable for me to run into the group as they were returning. They also spend a lot of time every day chatting between their offices. Stuff I don\'t end up hearing about like new houses or promotions. I\'m pretty sure I\'m not getting the cold shoulder from my colleagues because individually they all stop in every day to chat with me. It\'s pretty clear that no one wants to say \'no\' to the boss or to say &quot;wait I\'ll go get Jan&quot;.&nbsp; </p><p>The boss admits that due to her own problems she may have spoken to me in a &quot;cold manner&quot;. It\'s not cold. It\'s so mean that my colleagues and people from the other section come over to ask if I\'m ok.&nbsp; Five minutes later she\'s chatting amiably with my colleagues.&nbsp; </p><p>Am I whining? How long do the effects from cancer treatment last? Will I be messed up forever? Is this my new normal?&nbsp; </p><p>Should I take offense that I\'m left out of coffee breaks and hallway chit-chat? How do I know if I\'m just being bitter??&nbsp;</p><p>Does anybody have any suggestions for how to deal with this until I can find a different job?? </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Never give up!<br />Dx 7/13/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

I was a per diem, with no benefits, so low productivity really impacted me more than them.

        'content': "<p>Wow, you guys are fantastic.Thanks for your comments and support. </p><p>It was obvious this morning that stress effects fibromyalgia. I had to ask DH for help rolling out of bed. I even took extra painkillers and tranquilizers to work but ended up not using any of them. I was nose to the grindstone all day except for my lunchtime walk. As suggested I have documented the meeting from last week and I printed off the emails from my boss that contradict themselves. In the course of a week regarding the evaluation of a proposal I got \'this is great\' followed a week later with \'you really need to work on this\'. Nothing changed except her opinion.</p><p>I know the boss has a problem. One day I was in line at the pharmacy when I noticed the boss was right in front of me. She happened to turn and see me. Then, in tears, announced that she was joining the prozac generation. I\'m not sure if prozac should be her drug. Maybe something more for a bi-polar problem. Since all this stuff was going on before her announcement I don\'t think I can say that knowing her little secret is what\'s making her upset. I just think she\'s undermedicated. <img title=\'Tongue out\' src=\'/javascripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif\' alt=\'Tongue out\' /> </p><p>The routine of leaving me out started before I was even dx. When first hired I was the golden girl. Everyone else in the section had quit, every one of them complaining that the boss was micromanaging. So I was the only other employee. Slowly new people were hired and sometimes they went on coffee break too but most of the time it was me and the boss. Until two years ago, our manager was hired and the day she started work I was replaced on the coffee break runs. Nothing had changed when I got back to work last August. Over the winter, while I was working, the group started going without me. THAT actually hurt my feelings but I kept quiet. I\'m glad to hear from you all that I\'m not nuts to feel left out.</p><p>I do realize that I\'m not in 7th grade anymore and I have a little reminder posted on my monitor. In German, so I\'m the only one who can read it, it says that \'I\'m not at work to make friends, I am friendly while I am at work\'. It helps. :-)</p><p>Pabbie I wish I lived in CA. I don\'t know if they have similar programs here in Iowa but I will be looking into it.</p><p>Kira, Deanna, Patme and Swim: I remain in search of a new, more satisfying career. Believe me, I will not be quitting unless fully employed elsewhere. I\'ve grown accustomed to indoor plumbing. IF the boss decides to fire me I\'ll not be stepping out without a fight. I do stay out of gossip, always have, always will. I just got an idea for a new reseach paper - Workplace reactions to serious illness. </p><p>Barbe, can I pack you up and bring you home? </p><p>Today, to make sure my recovery continues, I made an appointment with a counselor to work on de-stressing myself and keeping an emotional even keel. Next week I\'ll be 50 years old. My son has worked for months now planning my first ever birthday party. He and his wife designed invitations with the breast cancer ribbon and have invited every person I\'ve ever known. Quite a few people have RSVP\'d but most importantly my family will be all in one place for a day. I\'m looking forward to a bite of cake and a day with family and friends. Meanwhile I\'ll keep working hard and I\'ll document, document, document!! </p><p>Thanks ladies - you\'re luverly!</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Never give up!<br />Dx 7/13/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

        'content': "<p>Thank you everyone. I feel less alone. I have PTSD flare ups. I have pretty much a low grade depression always. The anxiety is the worst...I have decided I have&nbsp;an anxiety addiction if that makes any sense. I keep myself in hyped up mode, anticipating danger, and avoiding other feelings. My thoughts race and it\'s been hard to&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp;I am 43 and have been dealing with these symptoms since I was 18. Had many years of therapy to address the sexual abuse PTSD, and that just flares up occasionally now. Well it is flaring up a bit more now that I am dealing with all this breast stuff. I have PTSD related to my Mom\'s breast cancer battle. </p><p>I try to escape with food, caffiene and nicotine addictions. I am on medication, though the anxiety stuff needs more of concentrated cognitive behavioral therapy. The progress I was making seems to have flown out the window the last 3 weeks. I am doing things that are not self care. UGH! I hear my therapist saying &quot;stop indulging the stimulants and compulsive/obssesion with the breast cancer site. Take a walk. Distract.&quot; Yet I am not doing that. &nbsp; I have taken extra anxiety pills on and off the last two weeks, and extra Seroquel which knocks me out when I dont want to tolerate the anxiety. I keep getting back in bed and sleeping to escape. I thought I would have the results of the biopsy yesterday. In fact I knew I would. </p><p>The results are in and sitting on my Surgeons desk. I want to run over to her office and open the folder myself. The office staff informed me yesterday when I called that she was on vacation Thurs and today and won\'t be back in until Mon. So I have the weekend to get through. &nbsp; I had it planned out in my mind. Get the results Thurs/Fri, calm myself down over the weekend, go to therapy on Mon to get support, and maybe even do something fun this weekend. I was going to try to go to this cookout and maybe meet some new people. Ah but I have social anxiety. So I will not go. I know me. So I beat myself up for not making myself go. I dont have any close friends here. </p><p>I know at some point I will have a double masectomy even if I dont have invasive cancer. I am high risk and on the 6 month monitoring routine. It\'s just deciding when at this point and depends on insurance coverage. I am choosing this cause I cannot live in fear of getting cancer. At this point I am taking it 6 months at a time in regards to that decision. </p>",

        'content': "<p>Hi Cleomoon- this thread has really touched me. The irony is I was telling someone the other day what my life was like in my 20\'s and 30\'s and they didn\'t believe me, because I am so different now.I\'m 55 yrs old and I have to say I hope I never go back to that dark place. I have been on Prozac since 1990 and I will never NOT take it! It is to me what insulin is to diabetics. I have tried twice to go off it and both times symptoms came screaming back. I am utterly convinced that depression is a biochemical disorder !<br /><br />Like many of you ladies-I grew up in a highly dysfunctional family. Alcoholic grandparents who created a crazy daughter (my mom-also suffers from depression and is a FLAMEING CODEPENDANT) who married my dad (a WWII vet who self-medicated his PTSD with alcohol) My dad was raised by foster parents after his mother died, until he was 8 yrs old and then his dad remarried a \'refrigerator.\' So needless to say I was raised by two people who totally lacked the basics needed to parent healthfully. And needless to say I am totally neurotic. Mix a biochemical depression with neurosis and you have a mess!!! <br /><br />In my teenage and college years I was very aware I had problems-but didn\'t know what to do about them. I was a pre-med major and I was petrified to ask for help because of the stigma attached (this was the 70\'s) and I was afraid it would prevent me from getting in med school.LOL It was probably what kept me out!!!  Anyway by 1979 I got career in gear and finished med tech school and was finally able to afford therapy. I had a wonderful shrink who basically reparented me and we addressed a lot of my neurotic issues. But even after 8-10 years I was still suffering from depression and anxiety. In those years I also got involved with alanon and adult children of alcoholics and while I was able to develop more healthy coping skills - I was still symptomatic. I had tried some of the older drugs (Xanax,amitriptiline) but none of them really helped. When Prozac came out I begged my dr to try, but he was hesitant because it was so new and early on there was so much bad press about it. So I soldiered on!! In 1989 I graduated from nursing school and started my 1st job in critical care. BIG MISTAKE. The stress almost put me over the edge and within 9 mos I was begging my dr to put me in the hospital. He said enough is enough and we tried the Prozac. Within 10 days my symptoms TOTALLY disappeared. It was like someone flipped a light switch!! Too bad I had quit my nursing job.-but I\'ve never look back with regret. My symptoms of depression and anxiety were often times paralyzing, and I often slept to escape them. The worst of which was constant obsessing-I could not go to sleep until I wrote down everything that was going round and round in my head. I read those old journals now and I can\'t believe the stuff I thought about!!! I also would cry at the drop of a hat. Anger was a big problem, as was CONSTANT suicidal thoughts. I attempted suicide 2x and was hospitalized both times.I had panic attacks because I was afraid to be home alone with my suicidal self.  Nothing worked until I found the right med. I am not that same person. I\'m telling you all this because you have to keep trying. If the med you were taking helped, then don\'t stop it. If it didm\'t work-keep trying different ones, until you find the right one. Some people have to try many different ones until they find the right one. The drugs are very similar chemically-but each person\'s chemistry is different as to how they respond.<br /><br />To you other ladies who have suggested other modalities, please don\'t think I\'m poo-pooing them because I have tried all of them and yes they were helpful in COPING with the depression and anxiety, but they didn\'t cure it. Only the med did that-in some people IT HAS TO BE BIOCHEMICAL. The irony is when I started the meds my PMS symptoms totally went away too. When I told my shrink about it he laughed and kind of said \'if you say so\'. Today Prozac is used for PMDD. Who\'d a thunk??! There is still so much we don\'t know about neurochemistry, but at least it\'s come out of the closet a little bit. Depression is a real physical illness and like other physical illnesses stress makes it worse. And BC diagnosis and treatment IS stressful!! So be very gentle with yourself and good luck with your surgery. Have a blessed night.  LynnePS One of my favorite quotes was one by F.Scott Fitzgerald the author of The Great Gatsby, who also suffered from depression; \'In the dark night of the soul-it\'s always three o\'clock in the morning\'</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Yesterday is history.

        'content': "<p>Hi ladies I was reading through this thread and I though I might be able to answer some questions. Im an RN and I\'m happy to share my personal and professional experience.<br />Someone mentioned constipation-ever try Miralax? It\'s very easy to take-mix with any liquid, hot or cold-totally dissolves and tasteless. It works great. I give it to my mom for morphine associated  chronic constipation.<br /><br />Also Lexapro is a SSRI and should be taken continuously-not off and on,on a daily basis. It is meant to be taken long term. (6months to a year-maybe even longer if needed) . You can stop for awhile and see how things go. And restart if needed at another time. It is not addictive, but you do need to taper off when you stop it -don\'t just abruptly stop taking. In my humble opinion no one should ever be ashamed to take an antidepressant, depression is a real physical illness and should be treated. I have been on prozac fo 20 years and I hope it never goes off the market. I thank God for it every day. If one SSRI has a SE you don\'t like, try lowering the dose or try another. <br /><br />Those who were asking about Xanax and Ativan-these are benzodiazepines (like valium) and they can be used off and on , on a daily basis as needed.  Keep in mind that theydo have the potential to be addictive  and you can develope tolerance (higher dosed needed to achieve the desire effect). If you do happen to become addicted (I was, I took xanax for a year for panic disorder many years ago) just keep in mind that you should NOT stop them cold turkey-you will go through withdrawal if you do and could experience life threatening seizures. They have to be tapered off. For those who have depression and anxiety or sleep problems some SSRIs are more sedating than others and if you take later in the day, may help with sleep.<br /><br />Hope this helps    Lynne</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Yesterday is history.

        'content': "<p>Hi Ivorymom. Glad you\'re getting good results with your smaller dose of the Lexapro. Some times you just have to keep tweaking it until you find the right balence. I\'m glad you mentioned the anti-anxiety benefits of the antidepressant, that\'s something I\'d forgot to mention. Many times depression has anxiety as a symptom, but people recognize the anxiety more because it interferes more with their day to day life. Plus I think when your crying all the time, THAT IS upsetting. Anyway, I found that after I was on the SSRI my anxiety level went way down also. It dosn\'t work that way for everyone, but it\'s worth a try. I hope your treatment goes well, I see you were just DX in feb.

Yes, I\'m depressed, dammit, I mean who wouldn\'t be in a situation like this? I\'ll bet there isn\'t one single woman anywhere on this forum who was happy and wanted to celebrate being constantly exhausted and so anencephalic with chemo brain she couldn\'t think straight for more than 5 consecutive minutes, and on top of that felt completely hideous and sexless besides. Right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The psychiatrist (who I went to on recommendation from my oncologist) recommended the Lexapro, and when I found out (from my good friend Google) that it has some of the same side effects of chemo I\'m already in the midst of, I called him up and asked him about that, saying how would I even know it if I was having side effects from Lexapro and would it make the chemo side effects worse? He said chemo\'s SEs were much stronger than Lexapro\'s so no I probably wouldn\'t be able to distinguish between Lexapro and chemo SEs.. but he said very few patients *get* SEs from Lexapro. Since my oncologist told me pre-chemo that I\'d tolerate it &quot;well&quot; (and I only really did for the first round: I\'ve had four now, with two more to go), I\'m kind of skeptical. But it is true that I\'m depressed, and from my reading today, not only did Lexapro sound like the &quot;best&quot; of the SSRI antidepressants, I took the time to briefly look into tricyclic, tetracyclic and MAO antidepressants (thinking if any of those seemed OK I\'d ask the psychiatrist if I could try one of those instead)...But, those seem much worse, not just SEs but addiction potential and (MAOs) food issues (not only do I love cheese and don\'t want to give it up, but can\'t be bothered with &quot;watching what I eat&quot; for any reason: I have never once gone on a diet in my life! I\'d rather just dress to hide those yucky 15 pounds around my middle).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So....Lexapro sounds like the only way to go here...which means as of tomorrow morning, you can put me on the list of BC patients taking Lexapro. My prescribed dosage is a 10 mg tablet once a day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>~Lena.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 2/9/2009, IBC, 6cm+, Stage IV, / nodes, mets, ER+, HER2+</div>",

        'content': "<p>Hi Lena-You\'re right that breast cancer and treatment would make any one depressed. I suspect many people are on antidepressants and don\'t tell anyone. That said, some people make it throught without significant depression and don\'t need meds. But others who may have a familial or physical predisposition to depression may find out that the stress of treatment puts them over their personal theshold. Sometimes the biochemical changes induced by the chemo or sleep deprivation can actually change your brain chemistry towards depression. It is not strickly a psychological issue, there is a lot of biochemistry involved. Taking the Lexapo (or another SSRI) for trial may help you feel better and therefore tolerate your treatment better. They not only help with depression, but also anxiety and sleeplessness. As for SE\'s, don\'t go looking for trouble-this is a case where too much information may not be helpful. You\'ll know if it\'s something bothersome. But know that the SSRI\'s generally have the least amount of SE\'s of all the antidepressants. As your research showed MAOs have quite a few and they also have the dietary problems and other drug interactions. The older tricyclics also have bothersome SE\'s and can be a problem if you have any cardiac issues. Many of us who are on an SSRI for chronic depression had tried the others in the past and stopped them because of problems with intolerable SE\'s. I for one am extremely grateful for the newer drugs, because they work and you really don\'t know your taking them, other than you don\'t feel depressed!<br />If the dose is correct you shouldn\'t have any problems. Keep in mind the reason there are so many SSRI\'s is because chemically they are each tweaked slightly different, you may find one dosn\'t work but another does. Sometimes you have to tweak the dosage. There\'s a litle bit of trial and error involved,  but the rewards are definitely worth it. I\'ve been on Prozac for 20 years, and it has been life altering for me-definitely for the better. The only SE I have is a decreased libido, but I\'m single and for me it\'s a non-issue. If it, or any other SE is bothersome, lower the dose or try another med. Also if it makes you sleepy, take it in the evening. Everyone\'s reponse is a little different and you have to be a little flexible and patient.,as you won\'t have results for a week or two. Good luck with your trial and I hope it helps. And please don\'t feel bad about taking the med-it\'s not a character flaw-it\'s a real chemical change, and there\'s no shame in getting help to improve the quality of your life. Let us know how it goes for you.{{{ hugs}}}    Lynne</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is God\'s gift--that\'s why it\'s called THE  PRESENT !</div>",

I\'m calling the psychiatrist\'s office in half an hour as soon as he opens to tell him I have to get off and ask about the &quot;how&quot; to get off it.

But then I found not only did it take me longer to have an orgasm (I, um, &quot;played solitaire&quot; once on Thursday and once on Friday, as the urges had hit me), but the orgasms I had weren\'t &quot;full-bodied&quot; like they used to be (even on chemo, like when my boyfriend was here last and he &quot;inspired&quot; me: I didn\'t have as much sexual energy as I did pre-chemo but what I had was fully functional!). I questioned the &quot;lite&quot; orgasm on Thursday and thought maybe it was a fluke maybe  but when it happened again on Friday I went online and saw sexual dysfunction (including &quot;anorgasmia&quot; listed as an SSRI SE) -- I dunno how to describe it but it just wasn\'t right. <br /> <br />This is just plain and simply NOT F***ING ACCEPTABLE.

But, I found myself thinking about you during the day, and wanted to offer a couple of thoughts I\'ve had about your question.</p><p>First, I don\'t think you\'re totally crazy or even the slightest bit crazy.I have a feeling that what might be happening to you is some sort of protective defense mechanism --in other words, if on any level you think you might have a recurrence, and God forbid it happens, well, then it\'s not so big a shock, because you were right. I\'m not a psychologist, but I know our minds can do strange things to protect us, and unless you\'ve always been incredibly psychic, I don\'t see how you could ever know the future.</p><p>The other thing I want to suggest is that youtalk to a psychologist who deals with breast cancer patients. Most hospitals have them on staff, andthey\'re usually available at no charge as part of your care. I\'ve done it twice, and both times was always so glad I did because they gave me a better understanding of something that was concerning me, as well as some practical coping strategies. My concern is that even though you love your life and feel that you\'re living it to the fullest now, if the beliefthat you\'ll have a recurrence continues to haunt your thoughts, you may find your decisions subconsciously influenced by it, and at some point no longer be really living life to the fullest because of it.</p><p>Hope this helps you and sueps, as well ~ Deanna</p><div class=\'post_sig\'>Deanna<br />Dx 2/1/2008, 1cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 1/16 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-</div>",

        'content': "<p>Abbey I felt like you do - just prior to my dx. I had the strangest feeling that something life-altering was going to happen to me - I kept looking at the lifeline on my hand and seeing how short it is........but I\'m much older than you, and once I passed the big 5-0 I entered the decade where my dad got brain cancer and died (59). So some of my feelings were superstitious and I tried to ignore them. But when I was dx\'d with bc, although I was shocked, deep down inside I was like \'this was what I was afraid of\'. I\'m also like you - enjoying life - but when the wind blows in the night, sometimes I hear my \'time\' passing........more quickly than I\'d like and out of my control. Still there\'s nothing positive to be gained from dwelling on these feelings - it\'s not like I\'m able to foretell winning Lotto numbers or anything - so I ignore the feelings and look at the beauty in the world around me. You are so very young - I\'m sorry for what you\'re going through.

        'content': "<p>Well that gives even more credence to why you feel the way you do Abbey! Your feelings are like a window into your heart............there\'s nothing wrong with these feelings especially since you sound so grounded to me. I read some of your earlier posts - you remind me of my 23 year old daughter in many ways - competitive, athletic, never wanting to take a \'nap\', lol. She was like that from the day she was born. It\'s part of who you are.........and it may be the very thing that keeps you going. We all know stories of people who have beat the \'odds\' - in all areas of life. How often did we hear doctors say a little baby survived because she had a \'stong will to live\'. I\'m a big believer in the WILL TO LIVE.........and Abbey you certainly have it! So I hope you won\'t worry too much about the future - these worrieswill always be there after what you\'ve been through - but the competitor in you can use theseworries toan advantage - like a challenge to win a race. It\'s a bit of a \'head-game\' I play with myself - some days I\'m more successful than others. The good news is - the more time passes, the more we \'win\' the fight against BC. And you sound like a winner already to me - living life to the fullest and loving your family and yourself. </p><p>Another thought about why sometimes we feel \'wrong\'............I wonder if deep down inside we aren\'t really DOING what we should with our lives? Do you have any creative talents that have lay hidden for many years? Or have you promised yourself to do a triathalon and never had time (especially with BC?) For me - late in life like this - I feel like my life is blessed - but my personal dreams never really came true. I always dreamed of becoming a writer - and it got waylayed in college and afterwards - then cold hard reality hit and dreams become \'silly\' like a Disney world commercial, \'When You Dream Upon a Star\' - but the child inside still wants to dream, no matter how old we get or what illness we have. You sound very perceptive to me Abbey - intuitive - strong. I bet you\'re a fantastic teacher...........dig deep into your heart and find your dreams and see if this is what is truly \'missing\'. BC is like a \'wake-up\' call for all of us - and we can use it to magnify our hearts and souls to find our real selves. </p><p>Hope I didn\'t go on and on too much - they don\'t call me \'Chatty Kathy\' for nothing! </p><div class=\'post_sig\'>3/3/08 Right-side mastectomy with immediate muscle-sparing free tram; 3/9/08 Developed abdominal MRSA staph infection and hernia;Completed 4 months Navelbine and 1 year Herceptin; Arimidex - 4 more years!

        'content': "<p>Hello all:</p><p>I just finished taxol almost 2 weeks ago. Had four rounds of AC then four of Taxol. I have been experiencing feelings such as you all have indicated. I have moments of sadness and cry because I know I can never live my life with the same carefree feelings I had before my breast cancer. I want my life back before BC. Now I have this little nagging constant companion and I don\'t know how to deal with living with this for the rest of my life, however long it may be. I am afraid of reocurrance. How does one get past this? Can one get past this? </p><p>I have tried to discuss how I feel with my husband sometimes, bless his heart he is just not comfortable about it. His answer is \'we all die sooner or later\'. And I say, yea, I know, but I\'d rather die way much later. I am 53.</p><p>I told him I was glad to be done with chemo, but at the same time afraid to be done, because while doing chemo it at least offered me protection while doing it. I\'m sure I will be on some type of pill next, and maybe that will offer me some solace. </p><p>I also find myself being just a little obsessed with finding out how I rate as far as survival rates go. </p><p>The feeling is almost like dealing with the aftermath of a loved one\'s funeral, though not as intense. It\'s a \'mad rush\' like you said Kira, and then the funeral is over, the people all go home and there you are all alone left to deal with the reality after the \'mad rush\'. It\'s almost as if I am in mourning. Maybe I am mourning my old life. Maybe this is a process just like you said Kira.</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><p>I don\'t go around moping all day long. I go about my day doing what needs to be done and days may go by without me even thinking of this. It\'s just that sometimes this creeps into my head, more so lately now that I\'m done with chemo. </p><p>Does anyone know of any good self help books on this subject for people with breast cancer? Maybe I can help myself by starting there.</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 10/18/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 2/26 nodes, ER+/PR-</div>",

I\'ve actually seen 2 at two different hospitals, and even though they were both good, one was far easier to talk to and had a verystraight-forward communication style. The other was a bit more wordy and academic in her approach, Igot some good ideas from her, but she wasn\'t nearly aseasy to talk to. I\'m only telling you this to point out that they\'re not all the same, and perhaps you can find someone better thantheone you saw.</p><p>Gitane ~ Boy, I could reallyrelate to the \'no man\'s land\' or \'void\' you talked about. In fact, last week I had lunch with a very dear friend and that\'s exactly what I was experiencing as I listened to her talk aboutthings that no longer seemed worth the drama to me. At one point, in response to her inquiry,I tried to share with her thatwhile I was feeling great physically,something was just \'different\' for me these days, whichshe quickly chalked off to a probable lack of estrogen!

I\'ve had the &quot;feeling&quot; - sure that from here on it\'s borrowed time til it comes back. I\'m 35. before I was diagnosed I had the feeling that &quot;something&quot; was wrong. the dx just confirmed that in my mind. I wasn\'t horribly unhealthy but I could have been better- in light of the bc I did&nbsp; a lot &quot;wrong&quot;- didn\'t have kids, moderately overwreight, I like to drink beer, smoked socially, not to mention the family history of BC I was unaware of (insurance won\'t pay for BCRA test- so I don\'t know).

But recovering from surgery and going through chemo have been the ultimate in procrastination excuses.</p><p>now that\'s its almost over-I have to make changes.

It had been seven years out for her and she said to me, &quot;I\'m just now&nbsp; beginning to believe in the future.&quot; I remember, at the time, thinking how completely wild that was but I think it\'s really important. I definitely feel that way. And it\'s slowly improving.&nbsp; </p><p>About a year after tx I had some back pain - there was some real point tenderness and it really worried me. I was also having some hip pain that I was totally convinced was muscular since it was kind of familiar. I had a bone scan and my onc called me up and said, &quot;Where was the pain you were having?&quot; I told her, my back, and she said, well, your back is fine but there\'s something that looks odd in your hip. I swear to you, sitting at my desk at work at that very moment my back stopped hurting and my hip started hurting! I was like, &quot;Oh, come on! Knock it off!&quot; but I couldn\'t change it with my consciousness. When the x-ray of my hip showed nothing both pains settled back down and worked their way away over time like all of the pains I\'ve ever had. And my whole attitude changed a LOT after that. It was kind of like facing a possibility, seeing how amazingly quickly my body responded to suggestion, just sort of calmed me down. I still had those thoughts after that but less intensely, less making me feel crazy.</p><p>What a road this is!!!!!!!!!! </p>",

I sure wish I had someone I could talk to...I haven\'t even had my mastectomy yet and I\'m a basket case. Mostly because of all the problems I keep encountering. I had a doctor who was going to perform the surgery, and a plastic surgeon, who was willing to take the pittance my insurance was reimbursing him (Provided by the County). The &quot;Clinic&quot; aka homeless haven, were I started my process wanted to enroll me in &quot;A Program&quot;. I\'ve since found out that, once I\'m in the program,&nbsp; I can\'t go the hospital with the 2 doctors I\'ve already scheduled to do my surgery. The woman doctor (whom I\'ve never met) in charge at the clinic must have called my surgeon because now my surgeon is not confirming my pre-op and mastemoy dates we had set up. She said the doctor at the clinic wanted to talk with me prior to confirming scheduling my pre-op and mastectomy. It was already scheduled!!!! She\'s scared her into not doing it!!! Stupid doctor, she\'s hell bent on sending me to that pilot hospital. The hospital I was going to is 5 minutes from my house and is a great hospital. Here\'s a comparison in both general surgeons and plastic surgeons at both hospitals the good one being first GS Good Hosp 41 Bad 10, PS 71 Bad 3. You don\'t have to be a rocket scientist to know were one would get better care. I almost want to contact the newspaper and report the horrid care. As if, that would make a difference.... My 31 yr old daughter&nbsp; said I should be glad and take comfort in that, at least I have the not so great hospital to go to. Yeah, it\'s a real comfort. I haven\'t told my Mother nor 2 sisters, for the same reasons I\'ve read in many posts here. I\'ve tried everything I could possibly think of. I\'ve asked my rich uncle for $13,000 for the good plastic surgeon I wanted. He denied me. After making me wait for a week so he could think about it-he was out of town. He said I should be most concerned with my health and that a good friend had told him that implants would obscure future mammograms. Mind you my uncle sold his company a couple of years ago for 3.8 million dollars...I contacted the Susan B Komen Foundation. The woman asked me if I had insurance. I told her yes, but it was bottom of the barrel from the county. She just gave me a phone no. to call. It turned out to be a place you could get screening done. I already had all that! And had told her so.</p><p>I\'m not homeless. I just got laidoff from my State job, which BTW didn\'t provide health care&nbsp; coverage. I\'ve worked for the Federal Government and had good health care when I did.How/Why is it that someone like myself ends up in this predicament?</p><p>I\'m thinking about just walking into the good hospital @ my scheduled date and telling them I want an emergency mastectomy. Maybe that would work...</p><p>Sorry for boring everyone. I just have no one else who listens, willingly... </p>",

My first thought is, it\'s your body, and you shouldn\'t be forced into using surgeons you\'re not happy with. But, since you haven\'t met the \'new\' team yet, perhaps you should do that, just to see if they might be better than you think. The other thing you could do is call the original surgeons and ask them if you choose not to take part in the clinic\'s program because you do not have confidence in the surgeons or hospital involved, would they still honor the commitment they\'d made to do your surgery before the clinic got involved. Afterall, I don\'t think that clinic can force you to use them.</p><p>As far as your uncle goes, I\'m not sure if he based his decision on advice he believed to be in your best interest, or if he was happy to have an excuse not to get involved.

But I wanted to share some ideas on chosing doctors, managing bills, etc.</p><p>Frist,&nbsp; take charge of your medical treatment. If you don\'t feel comfortable with a doctor or other provider(s), find another.&nbsp; I recommend seeking treatment at National&nbsp; Cancer Centers, if it is possible for you&nbsp; Because they are teaching/research/treatment centers they have educated health care teams who understand cancer patients and want to help.( I got treatment at Ohio State\'s James Cancer Hospital, after moving from Las Vegas) </p><p>Talk to the oncology social worker at your hospital.This person can connect you with financial resources. Hospitals that receive federal funding, like National Cancer Centers, have programs in place to help those who have no or little insurance, if you qualify. But it takes time and patience to wait until approval and you\'ll get bills in the meantime.</p><p>Have a trusted caregiver or family member take care of the billing, insurance, and financial paperwork mess. Once under the throes of treatment you won\'t want to deal with money matters, but do keep yourself informed. </p><p>It\'s indeed scary&nbsp; when you are first diagnosed and don\'t know where to turn. Fighting cancer becomes your &quot;full-time job&quot;&nbsp; we are all there with you. -Judy</p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 5/22/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+</div>",

And sometimes it\'s not who you think it will be, but maybe someone you didn\'t know as well who steps forward and gives of themselves beyond anything you would have ever expected. Try not to be too hard on the ones who disappoint you. I honestly think it\'s because they just don\'t know and can\'t relate to what you\'re going through. In the mean time, maybe let some other friends or family know your needs.

Our surgeon who performed the Lumpectomy was very good and happend to find a second distinct cancer in the biopsy,with 2 of 7 Lymph nodes involved. The surgery went well with clear margins, the recovery went as expected. When we met with the new medical oncoligist at our local hospital all hell broke loose . Before we left the building I told the staff to stop setting up appointments because we were not coming back. We contacted the patient liason that same evening and I was on the hunt for an alternative the next morning. We ended up finding one of, if not the best oncoligist in the area and will never regret our choice. Since then I\'ve taken most of the notes although my wife has done all of the research, I\'ve been to every treatment, every appointment and read every report prior to printing it for her. I guess what I\'m trying to saay is that every individual is unique, every situation is different, I have a verrrrry hard time discussing my wifes cancer with her or ayone else. So please don\'t get all worked up over people not falling all over you because of your diagnosis. They may be scared. Next week we\'re having a double masecectomy followed by radiation and then maybe or not reconstruction. In the meantime a family reunion with a family who\'s mother passed many years ago from cancer, a reunion with a family who my wife is the first member to be diagnosed, and life goes on........ when you get those calls from people who are needy and you don\'t feel like dealing with it then don\'t. Pass them off to someone who can say no. caller ID is great</p><p>Good luck, my prayers are with Y\'all </p>",

        'content': "<p>I\'ll tell you that one of the biggest lessons I learned through cancer and all the emotional and relationship fall-out after it is that I never really knew how I\'d react to something until it really happened. I always kind of thought I had some things all figured out and, when it came to pass, I did not. In retrospect I realize that I did not have cancer figured out. I fell into the trap of thinking that &lt;gasp&gt; I had cancer and that cancer is the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone and it should all be about me, me, me. And, I\'ll tell you, I would have denied that completely at the time.</p><p>Yes, it\'s overwhelming. Yes, it\'s terrifying. Yes, it hurts, it makes you nauseous, exhausted, stupid. Yes, it takes up 99% of your energy. But so do a lot of other hurts and we need to recognize that in those around us. I had family members going through extremely stressful times at the same time as my cancer, friends who were having life changing events. It took me a while to let go of myself as the absolute center of the universe (even tho, obviously, we are the centers of our own universe I had to finally figure out how to make sure that I wasn\'t making myself the center of everyone else\'s universe) and, even through the hell of treatment, be a friend, a sister, a partner. Actually, cancer treatment was the first time that I actually let go of the role of &quot;the strong one&quot; (even while I was striving to be incredibly physically strong: exercising regularly, going to work as much as I could, etc). While that was a good thing (a very good thing) I also needed to learn the balance. </p><p>You get to pick and choose your friends and who you want to have around you. If someone who is having their own hard time is unable to be there for you if you are there for her/him then maybe you need to rething the relationship. But my advice is to remember that it\'s a relationship and it\'s take AND give - even if I think that my crisis is bigger than your crisis - it isn\'t, even if it\'s cancer, it\'s just mine. </p><p> It took a long time to heal some of the wounds that occurred during that time - both to my body and to some very close relationships. I really don\'t know if I could have done it any differently. I hope that I could have if I\'d really recognized what I was doing to myself.</p><p>I\'m only asking you to consider if this reflects any of how you are relating to your loved ones. It\'s just way too easy to get wrapped up in the Cancer thing. Remember also that, as much as it freaks us out it freaks out the people around us. It\'s probably worse for them because they can\'t DO anything about it. All we do is DO something about it and they just have to wonder what to say and how to act.</p><p>Oi, it\'s waaaaaay too late and I\'m rambling. Love to you, sister. </p>",

        'content': "<p>I\'m sorry you are having such a difficult time. What did your doctor say? It is very frustrating to&nbsp;be in pain and have so much responsibility. I hope your doctor gives you some good alternatives. Let me know.&nbsp; I am doing fairly well. There is no one to talk with about my breast cancer, though. I can talk to family but they really don\'t know. Now that I have my prosthesis and can wear most clothes they seem to have forgotten that I even had a mastectomy! Which is good. But there are times when I feel stressed and just don\'t say anything. For instance, I sleep in my prosthesis because I can\'t stand the awareness of just one breast when I sleep. It probably sounds silly but that is how I feel. &nbsp;Anyway, I sure do hope you find some help with the pain. </p><div class=\'post_sig\'><br />Dx 2/2/2006, DCIS, 3cm, Stage IIIa, Grade 1, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+</div>",

I have been housebound but manage to&nbsp; get out for daily walks. If I go to the grocery store, I go early in the day when there are few people around. My onc said no eating salads/veggies in restaurarnts because they usually aren\'t washed properly and again the risk of picking up bacteria is high.

I felt a little bad asking people to do this at first but I figure if I have to go through this chemo crap, I am going to try to protect myself as much as possible.</p><p>Being home alot has not been a picnic but I think it has reduced my risk of infection.

Typically, I have been a&nbsp;very healthy &amp; emotionally strong individual.&nbsp;I have 6 sisters- all Cancer free (thank god). This has been the first diagnosis of Breast Cancer in my immediate family.&nbsp;I went in for what I thought was a routine mammogram- I had no lump on my breast. Thus far- I have had 2 surgeries and I currently just finished my 2nd week of radiation.&nbsp;I put up a brave front and for the most part I feel fine, however,&nbsp;emotionally it has taken its toll on me! I am a single parent and I work full time. My mom was diagnosed with Lung Cancer a few weeks after&nbsp;I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Unfortunately, she is not doing so well. I have felt so bad about not being there to&nbsp;help my siblings care for her.&nbsp;This has also caused some dissension and bad feelings among my peers - I just want to scream at them and shout - &quot;where do you think I have been these last 5 months?&nbsp;This last week really was the worst - I left work to go to my radiation appt. and I was running late. Earlier in the day I received a letter in the mail from my siblings in regards to making pre-funeral arrangements for my mother. By the time I got to my radiation appt. (10 min late) I had an emotional melt down. As I&nbsp;laid down on the radiation table - I could not keep the tears from flowing.- I was so grief stricken. I also came to the&nbsp;realization that this is what has become of my life. I realize we all have bumps in the road of life and this is just mine.&nbsp;Frankly, right now, I don\'t want to put up a brave front, I don\'t want to remain positive, I just want to grieve, I want to scream, I want&nbsp;to be angry. </p>",
